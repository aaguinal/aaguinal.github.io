<p>I am a Computer Science PhD Student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am interested generally in the synchronization of model viewpoints of an engineered system. My current research is focused on formal traceability, change propagation, and synthesis within autonomous systems using category theory.</p>

<p>I am also a software engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory where I have designed and implemented prototype software platforms that support <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/PressRelease/190926">image analysis for humanitarian and disaster relief</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JHUAPL/meta-system">test and evaluation of metagenomic classifiers, and data integration and analysis of social media and other publicly available information.</p>

<p>My topic areas of interest include category theory, robotics, software engineering design, computer vision, and geospatial information systems. My hobbies include film-making, video editing, and going on scenic walks.</p>
