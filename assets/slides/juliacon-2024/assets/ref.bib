  abstract      = {We present CREST, an approach for causal reasoning in simulation to learn the relevant state space for a robot manipulation policy. Our approach conducts interventions using internal models, which are simulations with approximate dynamics and simplified assumptions. These interventions elicit the structure between the state and action spaces, enabling construction of neural network policies with only relevant states as input. These policies are pretrained using the internal model with domain randomization over the relevant states. The policy network weights are then transferred to the target domain (e.g., the real world) for fine t uning. W e p erform extensive policy transfer experiments in simulation for two representative manipulation tasks: block stacking and crate opening. Our policies are shown to be more robust to domain shifts, more sample efficient t o l earn, a nd s cale t o m ore c omplex settings with larger state spaces. We also show improved zero-shot simto-real transfer of our policies for the block stacking task.},

  abstract  = {Deep reinforcement learning has achieved great success in many challenging domains. However, sample efficiency and safety issues still prevent from applying deep reinforcement learning directly in robotics. Sim-to-real transfer learning is one feasible solution to tackle these problems and address the reality gap between simulation and reality. In this letter, we propose to combine meta-reinforcement learning and progressive neural network (PNN) by meta-training a policy for multiple source tasks and transferring it to the real-world robot via PNN (MetaPNN). We expect that training meta-policy over meta-tasks without considering dynamics discrepancy with our method can bridge the gap between simulation and reality with mismatched dynamics, and allow the agent to learn one single policy solving multiple tasks instead of using one policy network in PNN to solve one task. Meanwhile, the transferred meta-policy via PNN is expected to solve the target task and adapt to new situations at the same time. Our results in a variety of target tasks in AntPos and Reach with simulated manipulator show that MetaPNN can significantly improve the robot's learning efficiency and performance. Our further results in real-world Reach tasks with physical robot arm and a new task that is different from the meta-tasks show there might be a synergy between meta-learning and PNN.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous teams of autonomous robots offer a number of benefits for a variety of applications. But deploying such robots is a complex task that requires machine-interpretable descriptions in order to be flexible and adaptable. Formal descriptions in the form of ontologies are increasingly used to describe the functions of such autonomous robots in the form of capabilities and skills. However, these ontological descriptions and a corresponding invocation interface for skills need to be created, causing additional efforts for developers which are complex, time-consuming and error-prone. This contribution presents a Python framework that automates all these additional efforts. It supports a developer in implementing functionalities as skills by having them program only the skill behavior. The framework automatically takes care of generating a standardized state machine, an invocation interface and an ontological description. The presented framework can be used to implement arbitrary functionalities as skills using Python. This is demonstrated using two different evaluation case studies: a simplified behavior of a mobile robot as well as a machine learning algorithm used as an analytical skill for quality control. Both are integrated into an existing skill execution system and can interact with other skills based on their ontological description.},

Robot skills learning approaches to develop humanoid robotic systems would have greater impact if the models of the skill can be operated upon to generate new behaviours of increasing levels of complexity.

In order to enable mobile medical robots to autonomously and smoothly transport hospital casualties through narrow aisles, in this paper, we present a robot skill transfer technology, namely a human-robot skill transfer framework of mobile medical robots for autonomous motion with teaching by demonstration, which is that a smooth optimal path is planned through the human motion, and then the Kinect sensor is used to detect human bone movement to learn its motion trajectory so as to achieve trajectory tracking control. Meanwhile, using the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) constraint to minimize the error between the actual trajectory of the medical robot and the tracking reference path to control the motion trajectory accurately, human-computer interactive mobile medical robots can smoothly pass through narrow channels. Through research and analysis, it is demonstrated that the mobile medical robot proposed in this paper has great feasibility, which is of great reference value in the field of medical rescue.},

In this paper, we describe and implement an extension of $\mathsf{C}$-sets having data attributes with fixed types, such as graphs with labeled vertices or real-valued edge weights. We call such structures "acsets," short for "attributed $\mathsf{C}$-sets." Derived from previous work on algebraic databases, acsets are a joint generalization of graphs and data frames. They also encompass more elaborate graph-like objects such as wiring diagrams and Petri nets with rate constants. We develop the mathematical theory of acsets and then describe a generic implementation in the Julia programming language, which uses advanced language features to achieve performance comparable with specialized data structures.},

  abstract      = {Imitation learning is an effective approach for autonomous systems to acquire control policies when an explicit reward function is unavailable, using supervision provided as demonstrations from an expert, typically a human operator. However, standard imitation learning methods assume that the agent receives examples of observation-action tuples that could be provided, for instance, to a supervised learning algorithm. This stands in contrast to how humans and animals imitate: we observe another person performing some behavior and then figure out which actions will realize that behavior, compensating for changes in viewpoint, surroundings, object positions and types, and other factors. We term this kind of imitation learning 'imitation-from-observation,' and propose an imitation learning method based on video prediction with context translation and deep reinforcement learning. This lifts the assumption in imitation learning that the demonstration should consist of observations in the same environment configuration, and enables a variety of interesting applications, including learning robotic skills that involve tool use simply by observing videos of human tool use. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach in learning a wide range of real-world robotic tasks modeled after common household chores from videos of a human demonstrator, including sweeping, ladling almonds, pushing objects as well as a number of tasks in simulation.},

  abstract      = {Despite recent progress in Reinforcement Learning for robotics applications, many tasks remain prohibitively difficult to solve because of the expensive interaction cost. Transfer learning helps reduce the training time in the target domain by transferring knowledge learned in a source domain. Sim2Real transfer helps transfer knowledge from a simulated robotic domain to a physical target domain. Knowledge transfer reduces the time required to train a task in the physical world, where the cost of interactions is high. However, most existing approaches assume exact correspondence in the task structure and the physical properties of the two domains. This work proposes a framework for Few-Shot Policy Transfer between two domains through Observation Mapping and Behavior Cloning. We use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) along with a cycle-consistency loss to map the observations between the source and target domains and later use this learned mapping to clone the successful source task behavior policy to the target domain. We observe successful behavior policy transfer with limited target task interactions and in cases where the source and target task are semantically dissimilar.},

  abstract  = {This letter presents our solution for the Real Robot Challenge III1, aiming to address dexterous robotic manipulation tasks through learning from offline data. In this competition, participants were given two types of datasets for each task: expert and mixed. Each expert dataset is collected by a high-skill policy, whereas the mixed dataset is collected using both expert and non-expert policies. We found that the vanilla behavioural cloning (BC) can learn a very proficient policy with minimal human intervention when trained on expert datasets. Notably, BC outperformed even the most advanced offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, when applied to mixed datasets, the performance of BC deteriorates; similarly, the performance of offline RL algorithms is also less than satisfactory. Upon examining the provided datasets, it was apparent that each mixed dataset contained a significant proportion of expert data, which should enable the training of a proficient BC agent. However, the expert data is not labelled in the datasets. As a result, we propose a classifier to identify the pattern of the expert behaviour within a mixed dataset and then utilize it to isolate the expert data. To further boost the BC performance, we take advantage of the geometric symmetry of the arena to augment the training dataset through mathematical transformations. Ultimately, our submission outperformed that of all other participants.},

We pose this class of problem under a worst-case model within the framework of procrustean graphs, formulating the disclosure policy as a particular type of map on edge labels. We devise algorithms that, given a planning problem supplemented with an information stipulation, can find a plan, associated disclosure policy, or both jointly, if and only if some exists. The pair together, comprising the plan and associated disclosure policy, may depend subtly on additional information available to the observer, such as whether the observer knows the robot's plan (e.g., leaked via a side-channel). Our implementation finds a plan and a suitable disclosure policy, jointly, when any such pair exists, albeit for small problem instances.},

If these RL techniques are used for data-centric services running on cloud computing, serious data privacy issues may occur because it is required to exchange privacy-related user data for RL-based services between the users and the cloud computing platform. We consider using homomorphic encryption (HE) scheme, which enables cloud computing platforms to perform arithmetic operations without decrypting ciphertexts. Using the HE scheme, users are allowed to deliver only ciphertexts to the cloud computing platform for using RL-based services. We propose a privacy-preserving reinforcement learning (PPRL) framework for the cloud computing platform. The proposed framework exploits a cryptosystem based on learning with errors (LWE) for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Performance analysis and evaluation for the proposed PPRL framework are conducted in a variety of cloud computing-based intelligent service scenarios.},

  abstract  = {We examine a novel setting in which two parties have partial knowledge of the elements that make up a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and must cooperate to compute and execute an optimal policy for the problem constructed from those elements. This situation arises when one party wants to give a robot some task, but does not wish to divulge those details to a second party-while the second party possesses sensitive data about the robot's dynamics (information needed for planning). Both parties want the robot to perform the task successfully, but neither is willing to disclose any more information than is absolutely necessary. We utilize techniques from secure multi-party computation, combining primitives and algorithms to construct protocols that can compute an optimal policy while ensuring that the policy remains opaque by being split across both parties. To execute a split policy, we also give a protocol that enables the robot to determine what actions to trigger, while the second party guards against attempts to probe for information inconsistent with the policy's prescribed execution. In order to improve scalability, we find that basis functions and constraint sampling methods are useful in forming effective approximate MDPs. We report simulation results examining performance and precision, and assess the scaling properties of our Python implementation. We also describe a hardware proof-of-feasibility implementation using inexpensive physical robots, which, being a small-scale instance, can be solved directly.},

RoboGen leverages the latest advancements in foundation and generative models. Instead of directly using or adapting these models to produce policies or low-level actions, we advocate for a generative scheme, which uses these models to automatically generate diversified tasks, scenes, and training supervisions, thereby scaling up robotic skill learning with minimal human supervision. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a self-guided propose-generate-learn cycle: the agent first proposes interesting tasks and skills to develop, and then generates corresponding simulation environments by populating pertinent objects and assets with proper spatial configurations. Afterwards, the agent decomposes the proposed high-level task into sub-tasks, selects the optimal learning approach (reinforcement learning, motion planning, or trajectory optimization), generates required training supervision, and then learns policies to acquire the proposed skill. Our work attempts to extract the extensive and versatile knowledge embedded in large-scale models and transfer them to the field of robotics. Our fully generative pipeline can be queried repeatedly, producing an endless stream of skill demonstrations associated with diverse tasks and environments.},

  abstract      = {Reinforcement learning (RL) for motion planning of multi-degree-of-freedom robots still suffers from low efficiency in terms of slow training speed and poor generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based robot motion planning framework that uses implicit behavior cloning (IBC) and dynamic movement primitive (DMP) to improve the training speed and generalizability of an off-policy RL agent. IBC utilizes human demonstration data to leverage the training speed of RL, and DMP serves as a heuristic model that transfers motion planning into a simpler planning space. To support this, we also create a human demonstration dataset using a pick-and-place experiment that can be used for similar studies. Comparison studies in simulation reveal the advantage of the proposed method over the conventional RL agents with faster training speed and higher scores. A real-robot experiment indicates the applicability of the proposed method to a simple assembly task. Our work provides a novel perspective on using motion primitives and human demonstration to leverage the performance of RL for robot applications.},

In the rearrangement task, the goal is to bring a given physical environment into a specified state. The goal state can be specified by object poses, by images, by a description in language, or by letting the agent experience the environment in the goal state. We characterize rearrangement scenarios along different axes and describe metrics for benchmarking rearrangement performance. To facilitate research and exploration, we present experimental testbeds of rearrangement scenarios in four different simulation environments. We anticipate that other datasets will be released and new simulation platforms will be built to support training of rearrangement agents and their deployment on physical systems.},

This concise, original text for a one-semester introduction to the subject is derived from courses that author Emily Riehl taught at Harvard and Johns Hopkins Universities. The treatment introduces the essential concepts of category theory: categories, functors, natural transformations, the Yoneda Iemma, limits and colimits, adjunctions, monads, Kan extensions, and other topics. Suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, the text provides tools for understanding and attacking difficult problems in algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology. Drawing upon a broad range of mathematical examples from the categorical perspective, the author illustrates how the concepts and constructions of category theory arise from and illuminate more basic mathematical ideas. While the reader will be rewarded for familiarity with these background mathematical contexts, essential prerequisites are limited to basic set theory and logic.

Grounded in formal mathematics, ologs can be rigorously formulated and cross-compared in ways that other KR models (such as semantic networks) cannot. An olog is similar to a relational database schema; in fact an olog can serve as a data repository if desired. Unlike database schemas, which are generally difficult to create or modify, ologs are designed to be user-friendly enough that authoring or reconfiguring an olog is a matter of course rather than a difficult chore. It is hoped that learning to author ologs is much simpler than learning a database definition language, despite their similarity. We describe ologs carefully and illustrate with many examples. As an application we show that any primitive recursive function can be described by an olog. We also show that ologs can be aligned or connected together into a larger network using functors. The various methods of information flow and institutions can then be used to integrate local and global world-views. We finish by providing several different avenues for future research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Spivak, Kent.},

These functors parameterize projections, unions, and joins over all tables simultaneously and can be used in place of conjunctive and disjunctive queries.

We provide a modern implementation of graph rewriting techniques at the level of abstraction of finitely-presented C-sets and clarify the connections between C-sets and the typed graphs supported in existing rewriting software. We emphasize that our open-source library is extensible: by taking new categorical constructions (such as slice categories, structured cospans, and distributed graphs) and relating their limits and colimits to those of their underlying categories, users inherit efficient algorithms for pushout complements and (final) pullback complements. This allows one to perform double-, single-, and sesqui-pushout rewriting over a broad class of data structures. Graph transformation researchers, scientists, and engineers can then use this library to computationally manipulate rewriting systems and apply them to their domains of interest.},

  abstract        = {Classical planning representation languages based on first-order logic have been extensively used to model and solve planning problems, but they struggle to capture implicit preconditions and effects that arise in complex planning scenarios. To address this problem, we propose an alternative approach to representing and transforming world states during planning. Based on the category-theoretic concepts of $\mathsf{C}$-sets and double-pushout rewriting (DPO), our proposed representation can effectively handle structured knowledge about world states that support domain abstractions at all levels. It formalizes the semantics of predicates according to a user-provided ontology and preserves the semantics when transitioning between world states. This method provides a formal semantics for using knowledge graphs and relational databases to model world states and updates in planning. In this paper, we compare our category-theoretic representation with the classical planning representation. We show that our proposed representation has advantages over the classical representation in terms of handling implicit preconditions and effects, and provides a more structured framework in which to model and solve planning problems.},

  abstract        = {We present a framework for learning to plan hierarchically in domains with unknown dynamics. We enhance planning performance by exploiting problem structure in several ways: First, we simplify the search over plans by leveraging knowledge of skill objectives; second, shorter plans are generated by enforcing aggressively hierarchical planning; and third, we learn transition dynamics with sparse local models for better generalization. Our framework decomposes transition dynamics into skill effects and success conditions, which allows fast planning by reasoning on effects, while learning conditions from interactions with the world. We propose a simple method for learning new abstract skills, using successful trajectories stemming from completing the goals of a curriculum. Learned skills are then refined to leverage other abstract skills and enhance subsequent planning. We show that both conditions and abstract skills can be learned simultaneously while planning, even in stochastic domains. Our method is validated in experiments of increasing complexity, with up to 2{100} states, showing superior planning to classic non-hierarchical planners or reinforcement learning methods. Applicability to real-world problems is demonstrated in a simulation-to-real transfer experiment on a robotic manipulator.},

@article{Men2023,
  abstract        = {Given the problem of exploration and utilization, the high interaction cost of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sometimes unacceptable. Moreover, the model trained by DRL cannot adapt to the complex and changeable assembly environment quickly owing to the weak generalization ability. Thus, the knowledge transfer framework is established for different robot peg-in-hole assemblies in this article to reinforce the generalization ability of the assembly model and the utilization efficiency of data. In the framework, the source domain model is trained through the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. The model accurately predicts environmental information and dynamically adjusts the robot's movements based on the prediction. Combined with the PI controller, the flexible peg-in-hole assembly can be quickly achieved by the robot. The policy fusion between the source and target domain MDP is realized by the policy fusion transfer (PFT) algorithm designed in this article. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified and discussed based on the transfer experiments, involving different assembly objects and different assembly environments. The training results demonstrate that the environment is explored by the PFT algorithm in a safe range at the initial stage of training by reusing the assembly policy of the source domain and that the faster model convergence speed is achieved. Furthermore, the testing results suggest that the assembly success rate is improved by 26% and the assembly force is reduced by 30 N. Moreover, the knowledge transfer between different peg-in-hole assemblies is realized successfully.},

  abstract        = {Task planning is the problem of finding a discrete sequence of actions to achieve a goal. Unfortunately, task planning in robotic domains is computationally challenging. To address this, in our prior work, we explained how knowledge from a successful task solution can be cached for later use, as an “abstract skill.” Such a skill is represented as a trace of states (“road map”) in an abstract space and can be matched with new tasks on-demand. This paper explains how one can use a library of abstract skills, derived from past planning experience, to reduce the computational cost of solving new task planning problems. As we explain, matching a skill to a task allows us to decompose it into independent sub-tasks, which can be quickly solved in parallel. This can be done automatically and dynamically during planning. We begin by formulating this problem of “planning with skills” as a constraint satisfaction problem. We then provide a hierarchical solution algorithm, which integrates with any standard task planner. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the computational benefits of the approach for reach-avoid tasks.},

  abstract        = {Solving realistic robotic task planning problems is computationally demanding. To better exploit the planning effort and reduce the future planning cost, it is important to increase the reusability of successful plans. To this end, we suggest a systematic and automatable approach for plan transfer, by rethinking the plan caching procedure. Specifically, instead of caching successful plans in their original domain, we suggest transferring them upon discovery to a dynamically-defined abstract domain and cache them as “abstract skills” there. This technique allows us to maintain a unified, standardized, and compact skill database, to avoid skill redundancy, and to support lifelong operation. Cached skills can later be reconstructed into new domains on demand, and be applied to new tasks, with no human intervention. This is made possible thanks to the novel concept of “abstraction keys.” An abstraction key, when coupled with a skill, provides all the necessary information to cache it, reconstruct it, and transfer it across all domains in which it is applicable—even domains we have yet to encounter. We practically demonstrate the approach by providing two examples of such keys and explain how they can be used in a manipulation planning domain.},

@article{Bajpai2018,
  abstract        = {Domain-independent probabilistic planners input an MDP description in a factored representation language such as PPDDL or RDDL, and exploit the specifics of the representation for faster planning. Traditional algorithms operate on each problem instance independently, and good methods for transferring experience from policies of other instances of a domain to a new instance do not exist. Recently, researchers have begun exploring the use of deep reactive policies, trained via deep reinforcement learning (RL), for MDP planning domains. One advantage of deep reactive policies is that they are more amenable to transfer learning. In this paper, we present the first domain-independent transfer algorithm for MDP planning domains expressed in an RDDL representation. Our architecture exploits the symbolic state configuration and transition function of the domain (available via RDDL) to learn a shared embedding space for states and state-action pairs for all problem instances of a domain. We then learn an RL agent in the embedding space, making a near zero-shot transfer possible, i.e., without much training on the new instance, and without using the domain simulator at all. Experiments on three different benchmark domains underscore the value of our transfer algorithm. Compared against planning from scratch, and a state-of-the-art RL transfer algorithm, our transfer solution has significantly superior learning curves.},

  abstract        = {Deep reinforcement learning has achieved great success in many fields and has shown promise in learning robust skills for robot control in recent years. However, sampling efficiency and safety problems still limit its application to robot control in the real world. One common solution is to train the robot control policy in a simulation environment and transfer it to the real world. However, policies trained in simulations usually have unsatisfactory performance in the real world because simulators inevitably model reality imperfectly. Inspired by biological transfer learning processes in the brains of humans and other animals, sim-to-real transfer reinforcement learning has been proposed and has become a focus of researchers applying reinforcement learning to robotics. Here, we describe state-of-the-art sim-to-real transfer reinforcement learning methods, which are inspired by insights into transfer learning in nature, such as extracting features in common between tasks, enriching training experience, multitask learning, continual learning and fast learning. Our objective is to present a comprehensive survey of the most recent advances in sim-to-real transfer reinforcement learning. We hope it can facilitate the application of deep reinforcement learning to solve complex robot control problems in the real world.},

  abstract        = {High product diversity, dynamic market conditions, and a lack of skilled workers are current challenges in manufacturing. Industrial robots autonomously planning and completing upcoming production tasks can help companies address these challenges. In this publication, we focus on autonomous task planning within industrial robotics and investigate how to facilitate the use of automated planning techniques from the field of artificial intelligence for this purpose. First, we present a novel methodology to automatically adapt abstractly modeled planning domains to the characteristics of individual application cases a user intends to implement. A planning domain is a formalized representation of the robot's working environment that builds the basis for automated planning. Second, we integrate this approach into the procedure for developing skills-based industrial robotic applications to enable them to perform autonomous task planning. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the methodology within the application field kitting in two reference scenarios with a mobile robot and a stationary robot cell. Using our methodology, persons without expertise in automated planning can enable a robot for autonomous task planning without much extra effort.},

@article{Li2023,
  abstract        = {The uncertainty and dynamic of home environment present great challenges to the task planning of service robots. The nature of the home environment is highly unstructured, with a diversity of tasks and a variety of objects. In addition, human, the service principle of robots, dynamically changes the environment and shows a large number of demands in the form of commands. Therefore, interaction is necessary. Robots must have the ability to adapt to complex scenes and act intelligently. Robot task planning for serving in unstructured and dynamic home scenes has been overlooked in the existing reviews. This paper firstly explores primary sources of uncertainty in-depth and summarizes three challenges, i.e., reliable planning under uncertain and incomplete information, efficient planning for complex tasks, and scalable planning for task generalization. Secondly, key solutions to the three challenges are discovered; the advantages and limitations of various task planning techniques are assessed from the perspective of adaptability and intelligence. Finally, the promising avenues toward overcoming uncertainty, improving satisfaction and comfort of users, and enhancing learning skills and generalization are proposed.},
