abstract = {Heterogeneous teams of autonomous robots offer a number of benefits for a variety of applications. But deploying such robots is a complex task that requires machine-interpretable descriptions in order to be flexible and adaptable. Formal descriptions in the form of ontologies are increasingly used to describe the functions of such autonomous robots in the form of capabilities and skills. However, these ontological descriptions and a corresponding invocation interface for skills need to be created, causing additional efforts for developers which are complex, time-consuming and error-prone. This contribution presents a Python framework that automates all these additional efforts. It supports a developer in implementing functionalities as skills by having them program only the skill behavior. The framework automatically takes care of generating a standardized state machine, an invocation interface and an ontological description. The presented framework can be used to implement arbitrary functionalities as skills using Python. This is demonstrated using two different evaluation case studies: a simplified behavior of a mobile robot as well as a machine learning algorithm used as an analytical skill for quality control. Both are integrated into an existing skill execution system and can interact with other skills based on their ontological description.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of constructing abstract representations for planning in highdimensional, continuous environments. We assume an agent equipped with a collection of high-level actions, and construct representations provably capable of evaluating plans composed of sequences of those actions. We first consider the deterministic planning case, and show that the relevant computation involves set operations performed over sets of states. We define the specific collection of sets that is necessary and sufficient for planning, and use them to construct a grounded abstract symbolic representation that is provably suitable for deterministic planning. The resulting representation can be expressed in PDDL, a canonical high-level planning domain language; we construct such a representation for the Playroom domain and solve it in milliseconds using an off-the-shelf planner. We then consider probabilistic planning, which we show requires generalizing from sets of states to distributions over states. We identify the specific distributions required for planning, and use them to construct a grounded abstract symbolic representation that correctly estimates the expected reward and probability of success of any plan. In addition, we show that learning the relevant probability distributions corresponds to specific instances of probabilistic density estimation and probabilistic classification. We construct an agent that autonomously learns the correct abstract representation of a computer game domain, and rapidly solves it. Finally, we apply these techniques to create a physical robot system that autonomously learns its own symbolic representation of a mobile manipulation task directly from sensorimotor data|point clouds, map locations, and joint angles|and then plans using that representation. Together, these results establish a principled link between high-level actions and abstract representations, a concrete theoretical foundation for constructing abstract representations with provable properties, and a practical mechanism for autonomously learning abstract high-level representations.},

This concise, original text for a one-semester introduction to the subject is derived from courses that author Emily Riehl taught at Harvard and Johns Hopkins Universities. The treatment introduces the essential concepts of category theory: categories, functors, natural transformations, the Yoneda Iemma, limits and colimits, adjunctions, monads, Kan extensions, and other topics. Suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, the text provides tools for understanding and attacking difficult problems in algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology. Drawing upon a broad range of mathematical examples from the categorical perspective, the author illustrates how the concepts and constructions of category theory arise from and illuminate more basic mathematical ideas. While the reader will be rewarded for familiarity with these background mathematical contexts, essential prerequisites are limited to basic set theory and logic. Categories, functors, natural transformations -- Universal properties, representability, and the Yoneda lemma -- Limits and colimits -- Adjunctions -- Monads and their algebras -- All concepts are Kan extensions -- Epilogue : theorems in category theory.},

@article{Freund2001,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to facilitate the development and maintenance of translators for industrial robot programming languages. Such translators are widely used in robot simulation and offline programming systems to support programming in the respective native robot language. Our method is based upon a software architecture, that is provided as a complete translator framework. For the developer of a new translator, it offers convenient strategies to concentrate on robot specific language elements during the design and implementation process: fill-in templates, libraries for common functionality, design patterns etc., all tied up with a general translation scheme. In contrast to other compiler construction tools, the developers need not care about the complex details of a whole translator. As a matter of principle, the architecture offers a complete default translator (except for the grammar). Robot specific elements can be held in separate units - outside of the actual translator - to facil itate maintenance and feature extension. The most probable changes in the translator product life cycle are restricted to the adaptation of these units. Several translators built upon this framework are in actual use in the commercial robot simulation system COSIMIR{\textregistered} to support native language robot programming, as well as in the widely used robot programming system COSIROP to verify the syntax of robot programs.},
annote = {This paper provides a software architecture for a robot translation framework. This prompts the user to focus on specific language elements using templase, libraries, design patterns, etc.

Approaches to developing robot programs:
(1) general purpose language --> robot specific code to execute on robot controller
(2) programming using native robot programming language inside simulation environment

**How to handle changes to the language over time?**

Challenges with programming:
- There are a lot of proprietary robot programming languages
- Many do not have strict semantics, e.g. no grammars

All the code is translated to common assembler-like intermediate code (e.g. IRDATA, ICR)

**Translators are measured by development time**

Some requirements for translators in order for the developer to ignore repeated mechanisms in the language and instead focus on the differences:
A) Common functionality between languages should be standardized in libraries
B) Language specific things should fill-in templates, instead of re-implementing the whole thing
C) Common functionality need to be able to adapt to language specific issues
D) Libraries of intermediate code should be maintained

Translator system is based on basic phases in compilation.
Novel: The translation acts on the AST instead of each command independently

Programming languages have built-in components:
- predefined variables
- data types
- functions
- statements

Secret sauce: The program and each data structure in the AST is divided into a common part (which can be found in ordinary GPL) and a language specific part 

To make a new translator:
1) Define a grammar
2) Figure out built-in elements of the language. Add to language-specific AST (?)
3) Fill in templates of language specific units to handle language specific AST
4) Implement how to handle built-in data types in the context analysis unit
5) Add type compatibility to the context analysis unit
6) Analyze the language for things you missed
7) Implement built-in statements and functions in intermedia system code

**Just describes how parts of the compilation the user needs to handle during translation**},

ASAP accounts for gravity to design a sequence where each sub-assembly is physically stable with a limited number of parts being held and a support surface. We apply efficient tree search algorithms to reduce the combinatorial complexity of determining such an assembly sequence. The search can be guided by either geometric heuristics or graph neural networks trained on data with simulation labels. Finally, we show the superior performance of ASAP at generating physically realistic assembly sequence plans on a large dataset of hundreds of complex product assemblies.

It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases.

abstract = {Two less addressed issues of deep reinforcement learning are (1) lack of generalization capability to new goals, and (2) data inefficiency, i.e., the model requires several (and often costly) episodes of trial and error to converge, which makes it impractical to be applied to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we address these two issues and apply our model to target-driven visual navigation. To address the first issue, we propose an actor-critic model whose policy is a function of the goal as well as the current state, which allows better generalization. To address the second issue, we propose the AI2-THOR framework, which provides an environment with high-quality 3D scenes and a physics engine. Our framework enables agents to take actions and interact with objects. Hence, we can collect a huge number of training samples efficiently. We show that our proposed method (1) converges faster than the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods, (2) generalizes across targets and scenes, (3) generalizes to a real robot scenario with a small amount of fine-tuning (although the model is trained in simulation), (4) is end-to-end trainable and does not need feature engineering, feature matching between frames or 3D reconstruction of the environment.},

annote = {**Autonomous systems combine every major subarea of AI**

Major subareas in AI
- Perception uses sensory input
- Planning uses consequences of potential actions
- Reasoning uses facts it knows and derives conclusions
- Learning uses experience to update knowledge
- Communication uses mutual knowledge and continues to update


Types of logic:
- epistemic logic
- dynamic logic

Dynamic logic can easily be mapped to the real-world by understanding that the combined internal state and the state of the world is a state and actions as being state transitions.
The epistemic logic, however, requires that knowledge be "known" in the state. The ways we can translate that is to a computer is to either (a) describe a data structure that encodes this knowledge, such as labled graphs or records, which is called the interpreted-symbolic-structures (ISS) approach or (b) by updating the state of the machine and the environment using a situated automata approach.

## What are they doing?

They have described a new way of formally encoding the machine's knowledge base and the semantics that the designer is assigning to the elements of the knowledge base, namely the situated automata approach. This solves the problem of having the interpretation of the knowledge only be implicit when using the ISS approach.

## Strengths

- Provides an abstraction of encoding and updating knowledge that does not tie someone to a particular symbolic data structure

## Weaknessses

- How do you implement this in a computer?},

abstract = {To assist with everyday human activities, robots must solve complex long-horizon tasks and generalize to new settings. Recent deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods show promise in fully autonomous learning, but they struggle to reach long-term goals in large environments. On the other hand, Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches excel at solving and generalizing across long-horizon tasks, thanks to their powerful state and action abstractions. But they assume predefined skill sets, which limits their real-world applications. In this work, we combine the benefits of these two paradigms and propose an integrated task planning and skill learning framework named LEAGUE (Learning and Abstraction with Guidance). LEAGUE leverages the symbolic interface of a task planner to guide RL-based skill learning and creates abstract state space to enable skill reuse. More importantly, LEAGUE learns manipulation skills in-situ of the task planning system, continuously growing its capability and the set of tasks that it can solve. We evaluate LEAGUE on four challenging simulated task domains and show that LEAGUE outperforms baselines by large margins. We also show that the learned skills can be reused to accelerate learning in new tasks domains and transfer to a physical robot platform.},

Recently, the ROS software platform from Willow Garage has gained significant traction due to its adoption of sound design principles and significant software library contributions from Willow Garage itself. This paper describes a binding from the Haskell programming language to basic ROS interfaces. The novelty of these bindings is that they allow for, and encourage, a higher level of abstraction in writing programs for robots that treat streams of values as first-class citizens. This approach makes the fusing, transforming, and filtering of streams fully generic and compositional while maintaining full compatibility with the existing ROS ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Objects in a symmetric monoidal category are tensor products of all available resources. Composability of system functions is achieved when the tensor product of output resources for one function equals the tensor product of input resource to another function.
This paper tries to address the problem of streaming commands to the robot and functional abstractions of that.
Wholemeal programming is writing the program using data structures conceptual prior to considering how the structures are comprised.
The most common approaches to semantic sensor fusion are best on analytical methods such as joint probabilities from empirical collections. However, given that sensors are models that project real-world objects into their chosen representations, does there exist a subdued relationship between representations of the same real-world objects that can be exploited? (General thesis)
A program is derived from a conceptual expectation. If we make this conceptual expectation explicit in a chosen representation and we derive programs from this representation, can we say that two programs are equal. Can we observe how similar they are to the parent representation? Can we identify a metric for exacting the number of extensions and exclusions? Does this say something about the relationship between two programs? Can the inverse of these extensions and exclusions be used to translate between programs? (General thesis)
For many businesses that find themselves rapidly prototyping many systems, they have a motivation to see how similar their systems are to one another to avoid re-inventing the wheel. They also may seek to design systems that are derivatives of larger concepts to increase reusability. If their sub functional components have the same conceptual signatures (including resource types) at some abstraction-level, then those are places in these systems where data can be shared and transferred. (General thesis)
This representation makes it evident where opportunities for parallelism and asynchrony are available.
This paper provides a syntax for capturing semantic design theory for robot manipulator programs.
The next paper provides an example of comparing an existing program to this conceptual representation and observing similarities and differences.},

@article{Curry2013a,
abstract = {This thesis develops the theory of sheaves and cosheaves with an eye towards applications in science and engineering. To provide a theory that is computable, we focus on a combinatorial version of sheaves and cosheaves called cellular sheaves and cosheaves, which are finite families of vector spaces and maps parametrized by a cell complex. We develop cellular (co)sheaves as a new tool for topological data analysis, network coding and sensor networks. A foundation for multi-dimensional level-set persistent homology is laid via constructible cosheaves, which are equivalent to representations of MacPherson's entrance path category. By proving a van Kampen theorem, we give a direct proof of this equivalence. A cosheaf version of the i'th derived pushforward of the constant sheaf along a definable map is constructed directly as a representation of this category. We go on to clarify the relationship of cellular sheaves to cosheaves by providing a formula that defines a derived equivalence, which in turn recovers Verdier duality. Compactly-supported sheaf cohomology is expressed as the coend with the image of the constant sheaf through this equivalence. The equivalence is further used to establish relations between sheaf cohomology and a herein newly introduced theory of cellular sheaf homology. Inspired to provide fast algorithms for persistence, we prove that the derived category of cellular sheaves over a 1D cell complex is equivalent to a category of graded sheaves. Finally, we introduce the interleaving distance as an extended pseudo-metric on the category of sheaves. We prove that global sections partition the space of sheaves into connected components. We conclude with an investigation into the geometry of the space of constructible sheaves over the real line, which we relate to the bottleneck distance in persistence.},

abstract = {We present a strategy for designing and building very general robot manipulation systems using a general-purpose task-and-motion planner with both engineered and learned modules that estimate properties and affordances of unknown objects. Such systems are closed-loop policies that map from RGB images, depth images, and robot joint encoder measurements to robot joint position commands. We show that this strategy leads to intelligent behaviors even without a priori knowledge regarding the set of objects, their geometries, and their affordances. We show how these modules can be flexibly composed with robot-centric primitives using the PDDLStream task and motion planning framework. Finally, we demonstrate that this strategy can enable a single policy to perform a wide variety of real-world multi-step manipulation tasks, generalizing over a broad class of objects, arrangements, and goals, without prior knowledge of the environment or re-training.},

@article{Izquierdo-Badiola2022,
abstract = {Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) has become a major trend in robotics in recent years with the idea of combining the strengths from both humans and robots. In order to share the work to be done, many task planning approaches have been implemented. However, they don't fully satisfy the required adaptability in human-robot collaborative tasks, with most approaches not considering neither the state of the human partner nor the possibility of adapting the collaborative plan during execution or even anticipating failures. In this paper, we present a planning system for human-robot collaborative plans that takes into account the agents' states and deals with unforeseen human behaviour, by replanning in anticipation when the human state changes to prevent action failure. The human state is defined in terms of capacity, knowledge and motivation. The system has been implemented in a standardised environment using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and the modular ROSPlan framework, and we have validated the approach in multiple simulation settings. Our results show that using the human model fosters an appropriate task allocation while allowing failure anticipation, replanning in time to prevent it.},

abstract = {There is a hidden intrigue in the title. CT is one of the most abstract mathematical disciplines, sometimes nicknamed "abstract nonsense". MDE is a recent trend in software development, industrially supported by standards, tools, and the status of a new "silver bullet". Surprisingly, categorical patterns turn out to be directly applicable to mathematical modeling of structures appearing in everyday MDE practice. Model merging, transformation, synchronization, and other important model management scenarios can be seen as executions of categorical specifications. Moreover, the paper aims to elucidate a claim that relationships between CT and MDE are more complex and richer than is normally assumed for "applied mathematics". CT provides a toolbox of design patterns and structural principles of real practical value for MDE. We will present examples of how an elementary categorical arrangement of a model management scenario reveals deficiencies in the architecture of modern tools automating the scenario. {\textcopyright} 2012 Z. Diskin & T. Maibaum.},
annote = {**I love the passion in this paper. It makes me believe the writer is leading me to the correct conclusion that CT contain the appropriate structures for relating models. Love it!**

CT can be used as the theoretical framework to describe many, if not all, MBSE concepts. The reason why software engineering practitioners shy away from mathematical modeling in engineering is because the mathematics commonly referenced is too one-dimensional and does not capture the internal structure of relationships, merely the external structure.

In model-based systems engineering, the objective is to take pieces of the real-world and construct models that can achieve some limited fidelity that describes the an aspect of the world. The model may refer to an abstraction level and, thus other models have to be constructed to add refinements. The model and infrastructure that relates these models, i.e. the meta-meta-model, is termed as "modelware" in this paper. From these models, code templates can be structured and generated into software. Code then becomes just another model that is uniquely positioned at the last stop in the refinement hierarchy.

The universe of metamodels and models can be described using the following categories:

Metamodels := (G_M, C_M) syntax and semantics/constraints 

- Category of Graphs (syntactic description of models)
* Objects: Graphs
* Morphisms: Graph transformations

- Category of Models(M), i.e. Graphs mod-ed by metamodels (possible models for a given metamodel)
* Objects: Instances of metamodels, (G_A, t_A)
$\sim$ Model graph, G_A
$\sim$ Adding data to metamodel constructs, t_A: G_A \rightarrow G_M
* Morphisms: Instance mappings 
$\sim$ f: G_A \rightarrow G_B s.t. t_B \compose f = t_A (a transform that is still a instance of a metamodel)

- Category of Metamodels
* Objects: Metamodels, M
* Morphisms: Sketch morphisms, m: M \rightarrow N (graph transformations that adhere to constraints)

- Category of Models
* Objects: Instances of metamodels, (G_A, t_A)
* Morphisms: Product of Models(M) and metamodels morphisms
$\sim$ Models(M) morphisms: G_A \rightarrow G_B
$\sim$ Metamodels morphisms: G_M(A) \rightarrow G_M(B)

All in all, these are simply arrows in Graph category with some constraints applied. **The graphs can be parse trees or abstract syntax trees.**

There will likely be scenarios where the source metamodel has constructs that do not correspond to constructs in the target metamodel, but can be constructed from multiple constructs in the target metamodel. These operations can be modeled with a pair of monads. 

Monads??
Kleisli categories??

We propose a meta reinforcement learning framework to enhance the adaptability of collaborative robots to new tasks through task modularization and efficient transfer of policies from previously learned task modules. Our experiments on the OpenAI Gym Robotics environments Reach, Push, and Pick-and-Place indicate an average 75% reduction in the number of iterations to achieve a 60% success rate as well as a 50%-80% improvement in task completion efficiency, compared to the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm as a baseline.

A task plan is then initialized by computing the Graph Editing Distance (GED) between the initial contact graph and the goal configuration, which generates graph edit operations corresponding to possible robot actions. We finalize the task plan by imposing constraints to regulate the temporal feasibility of graph edit operations, ensuring valid task and motion correspondences.

@article{Juba2021,
abstract = {Creating a domain model, even for classical, domain-independent planning, is a notoriously hard knowledge-engineering task. A natural approach to solve this problem is to learn a domain model from observations. However, model learning approaches frequently do not provide safety guarantees: the learned model may assume actions are applicable when they are not, and may incorrectly capture actions' effects. This may result in generating plans that will fail when executed. In some domains such failures are not acceptable, due to the cost of failure or inability to replan online after failure. In such settings, all learning must be done offline, based on some observations collected, e.g., by some other agents or a human. Through this learning, the task is to generate a plan that is guaranteed to be successful. This is called the model-free planning problem. Prior work proposed an algorithm for solving the model-free planning problem in classical planning. However, they were limited to learning grounded domains, and thus they could not scale. We generalize this prior work and propose the first safe model-free planning algorithm for lifted domains. We prove the correctness of our approach, and provide a statistical analysis showing that the number of trajectories needed to solve future problems with high probability is linear in the potential size of the domain model. We also present experiments on twelve IPC domains showing that our approach is able to learn the real action model in all cases with at most two trajectories.},

abstract = {Within the realm of service robotics, researchers have placed a great amount of effort into learning, understanding, and representing motions as manipulations for task execution by robots. The task of robot learning and problem-solving is very broad, as it integrates a variety of tasks such as object detection, activity recognition, task/motion planning, localization, knowledge representation and retrieval, and the intertwining of perception/vision and machine learning techniques. In this paper, we solely focus on knowledge representations and notably how knowledge is typically gathered, represented, and reproduced to solve problems as done by researchers in the past decades. In accordance with the definition of knowledge representations, we discuss the key distinction between such representations and useful learning models that have extensively been introduced and studied in recent years, such as machine learning, deep learning, probabilistic modeling, and semantic graphical structures. Along with an overview of such tools, we discuss the problems which have existed in robot learning and how they have been built and used as solutions, technologies or developments (if any) which have contributed to solving them. Finally, we discuss key principles that should be considered when designing an effective knowledge representation.},

Our algorithm offers a joint framework of neuro-symbolic task planning and low-level motion generation conditioned on the specified goal. At the core of our approach is a two-level scene graph representation, namely geometric scene graph and symbolic scene graph. This hierarchical representation serves as a structured, object-centric abstraction of manipulation scenes. Our model uses graph neural networks to process these scene graphs for predicting high-level task plans and low-level motions. We demonstrate that our method scales to long-horizon tasks and generalizes well to novel task goals. We validate our method in a kitchen storage task in both physical simulation and the real world. Experiments show that our method achieves over 70% success rate and nearly 90% of subgoal completion rate on the real robot while being four orders of magnitude faster in computation time compared to standard search-based task- and-motion planner.},

abstract = {The uncertainty and dynamic of home environment present great challenges to the task planning of service robots. The nature of the home environment is highly unstructured, with a diversity of tasks and a variety of objects. In addition, human, the service principle of robots, dynamically changes the environment and shows a large number of demands in the form of commands. Therefore, interaction is necessary. Robots must have the ability to adapt to complex scenes and act intelligently. Robot task planning for serving in unstructured and dynamic home scenes has been overlooked in the existing reviews. This paper firstly explores primary sources of uncertainty in-depth and summarizes three challenges, i.e., reliable planning under uncertain and incomplete information, efficient planning for complex tasks, and scalable planning for task generalization. Secondly, key solutions to the three challenges are discovered; the advantages and limitations of various task planning techniques are assessed from the perspective of adaptability and intelligence. Finally, the promising avenues toward overcoming uncertainty, improving satisfaction and comfort of users, and enhancing learning skills and generalization are proposed.},

abstract = {With increased complexity and individualization of processes and products, the manufacturing industry experiences growing pressure to automate. To meet these constantly growing requirements regarding the flexibility of production and logistic systems, intelligent robotic systems that can adapt dynamically to changing process conditions are essential. Deep reinforcement learning provides a solution and offers a paradigm of learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous agents. However, the corresponding training procedure is based on trial-and-error interactions with an environment and is thus very data inefficient and costly in real-world scenarios. Transfer learning approaches can mitigate these costs and improve learning by leveraging control capabilities acquired in other settings, such as simulations, or from previously learning a different task. In this paper, we investigate the transfer of trajectories between different robot models. We propose a methodology that maps trajectory demonstrations from a source robot into trajectories of a target robot by using forward and inverse kinematics models. We introduce a similarity measure, that one the one hand compares different robot models using key poses along the kinematic chains, and on the other hand captures the efficiency of transitions. This similarity measure is used to select from the mapped trajectories those which are feasible, efficient and retain the general shape of the robotic arm. Finally, we perform behavioral cloning to pre-train a deep reinforcement learning policy for the target domain and demonstrate significant benefits compared to learning the target policy from scratch.},

abstract = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

We propose a new approach that uses off-the-shelf task planners and motion planners and makes no assumptions about their implementation. Doing so enables our approach to directly build on, and benefit from, the vast literature and latest advances in task planning and motion planning. It uses a novel representational abstraction and requires only that failures in computing a motion plan for a high-level action be identifiable and expressible in the form of logical predicates at the task level. We evaluate the approach and illustrate its robustness through a number of experiments using a state-of-the-art robotics simulator and a PR2 robot. These experiments show the system accomplishing a diverse set of challenging tasks such as taking advantage of a tray when laying out a table for dinner and picking objects from cluttered environments where other objects need to be re-arranged before the target object can be reached.},

abstract = {Imitation learning is an effective approach for autonomous systems to acquire control policies when an explicit reward function is unavailable, using supervision provided as demonstrations from an expert, typically a human operator. However, standard imitation learning methods assume that the agent receives examples of observation-action tuples that could be provided, for instance, to a supervised learning algorithm. This stands in contrast to how humans and animals imitate: we observe another person performing some behavior and then figure out which actions will realize that behavior, compensating for changes in viewpoint, surroundings, object positions and types, and other factors. We term this kind of imitation learning 'imitation-from-observation,' and propose an imitation learning method based on video prediction with context translation and deep reinforcement learning. This lifts the assumption in imitation learning that the demonstration should consist of observations in the same environment configuration, and enables a variety of interesting applications, including learning robotic skills that involve tool use simply by observing videos of human tool use. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach in learning a wide range of real-world robotic tasks modeled after common household chores from videos of a human demonstrator, including sweeping, ladling almonds, pushing objects as well as a number of tasks in simulation.},

abstract = {We describe a task and motion planning architecture for highly dynamic systems that combines a domain-independent sampling-based deliberative planning algorithm with a global reactive planner. We leverage the recent development of a reactive, vector field planner that provides guarantees of reachability to large regions of the environment even in the face of unknown or unforeseen obstacles. The reachability guarantees can be formalized using contracts that allow a deliberative planner to reason purely in terms of those contracts and synthesize a plan by choosing a sequence of reactive behaviors and their target configurations, without evaluating specific motion plans between targets. This reduces both the search depth at which plans will be found, and the number of samples required to ensure a plan exists, while crucially preserving correctness guarantees. The result is reduced computational cost of synthesizing plans, and increased robustness of generated plans to actuator noise, model misspecification, or unknown obstacles. Simulation studies show that our hierarchical planning and execution architecture can solve complex navigation and rearrangement tasks, even when faced with narrow passageways or incomplete world information.},

In some situations, a task may require the robot and the human to act together in a collaborative way in order to reach a common goal. To achieve a collaborative plan, each agent (human, robot) needs to be aware of the tasks she/he must carry out and how to perform them. This paper addresses the issue of enhancing a robotic system with a dynamic model of its collaborator's knowledge concerning tasks of a shared plan. Using this model, the robot is able to adapt its collaborative plan generation, its abilities to give explanations and to monitor the overall plan execution. We present the algorithm we have elaborated to take advantage of the tree representation of our Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner to enhance the robot with appropriate explanation and execution monitoring abilities. To evaluate how our adaptive system is perceived by users and how much it improves the quality of the Human-Robot interaction, the outcome of a comparative study is presented.},

Thus, the knowledge transfer framework is established for different robot peg-in-hole assemblies in this article to reinforce the generalization ability of the assembly model and the utilization efficiency of data. In the framework, the source domain model is trained through the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. The model accurately predicts environmental information and dynamically adjusts the robot's movements based on the prediction. Combined with the PI controller, the flexible peg-in-hole assembly can be quickly achieved by the robot. The policy fusion between the source and target domain MDP is realized by the policy fusion transfer (PFT) algorithm designed in this article. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified and discussed based on the transfer experiments, involving different assembly objects and different assembly environments. The training results demonstrate that the environment is explored by the PFT algorithm in a safe range at the initial stage of training by reusing the assembly policy of the source domain and that the faster model convergence speed is achieved. Furthermore, the testing results suggest that the assembly success rate is improved by 26% and the assembly force is reduced by 30 N. Moreover, the knowledge transfer between different peg-in-hole assemblies is realized successfully.},

abstract = {Definition of programming languages consists of the formal definition of syn-tax and semantics. One of the most popular semantic methods used in various stages of software engineering is structural operational semantics. It describes program behavior in the form of state changes after execution of elementary steps of program. This feature makes structural operational semantics useful for implementation of programming languages and also for verification purposes. In our paper we present a new approach to structural operational semantics. We model behavior of programs in category of states, where objects are states, an abstraction of computer memory and morphisms model state changes, execution of a program in elementary steps. The advantage of using categorical model is its exact mathematical structure with many useful proved properties and its graphical illustration of program behavior as a path, i.e. a composition of morphisms. Our approach is able to accentuate dynamics of structural operational semantics. For simplicity, we assume that data are intuitively typed. Visualization and facility of our model is not only a new model of structural operational semantics of imperative programming languages but it can also serve for education purposes.},

Together, these constituents can accomplish missions that otherwise could not be performed by any of them separately. In another perspective, knowledge representation approaches can assist in the establishment of a common understanding in this field by formalizing and standardizing the main terms and concepts adopted. In spite of the relevance of SoS, a consolidated terminology which could support the community working with such systems is still missing. Furthermore, the multiplicity of stakeholders, technologies, and expertise involved in an SoS makes the need of a common understanding even more imperative. In this study, we report on the main findings of a systematic literature review covering knowledge representation approaches in the SoS field. With this study, we are able to present a comprehensive panorama of the knowledge representation approaches that are currently adopted. Even though a consolidated terminology is not available yet, such panorama can be helpful for devising a common, comprehensive terminology for the SoS field. Therefore, we conclude this paper with directions for future work. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

This may require opening a drawer to observe its contents or moving an object out of the way to examine the space behind it. Upon receiving a new observation, the robot must update its belief about the world and compute a new plan of action. In this work, we present an online planning and execution system for robots faced with these challenges. We perform deterministic cost-sensitive planning in the space of hybrid belief states to select likely-to-succeed observation actions and continuous control actions. After execution and observation, we replan using our new state estimate. We initially enforce that planner reuses the structure of the unexecuted tail of the last plan. This both improves planning efficiency and ensures that the overall policy does not undo its progress towards achieving the goal.

abstract = {Landmarks are one of the most effective search heuristics for classical planning, but largely ignored in generalized planning. Generalized planning (GP) is usually addressed as a combinatorial search in a given space of algorithmic solutions, where candidate solutions are evaluated w.r.t. the instances they solve. This type of solution evaluation ignores any sub-goal information that is not explicit in the representation of the planning instances, causing plateaus in the space of candidate generalized plans. Furthermore, node expansion in GP is a run-time bottleneck since it requires evaluating every child node over the entire batch of classical planning instances in a GP problem. In this paper we define a landmark counting heuristic for GP (that considers sub-goal information that is not explicitly represented in the planning instances), and a novel heuristic search algorithm for GP (that we call PGP) and that progressively processes subsets of the planning instances of a GP problem. Our two orthogonal contributions are analyzed in an ablation study, showing that both improve the state-of-the-art in GP as heuristic search, and that both benefit from each other when used in combination.},

First, we present a novel methodology to automatically adapt abstractly modeled planning domains to the characteristics of individual application cases a user intends to implement. A planning domain is a formalized representation of the robot's working environment that builds the basis for automated planning. Second, we integrate this approach into the procedure for developing skills-based industrial robotic applications to enable them to perform autonomous task planning. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the methodology within the application field kitting in two reference scenarios with a mobile robot and a stationary robot cell. Using our methodology, persons without expertise in automated planning can enable a robot for autonomous task planning without much extra effort.},

We also allow processes which have no inputs or no outputs, called sources and sinks. These

scalar processes can be used to set global parameters and other environmental variables. 






In linear syntax, parallel composition is usually denoted by the tensor symbol ⊗, so that the complex process just above would be written drill ⊗ cut. The use of this symbol is purely con- ventional: it is independent of (though related to) other uses of the tensor symbol in mathematics. 






"When we compose two processes serially, we use the output of one process as the input to the next. This means that serial composition only makes sense when type(s) of the output resource(s) in the first process match the input resource(s) of the second.”






In short, a string diagram represents the way that a single complex process is composed from simple processes. A category is a collection of all possible complex processes which can be composed from a collection of simple processes. 






All possible traces that satisfy end state form a category?






The information encoded in string diagrams is topological rather than geometric: it concerns what is connected to what, rather than their particular positions.

**Twists don't block processes**






"A category (without modifiers), is a mathematical structure for studying serial composition and identities; every process has a single input and output and there is no parallel composition. These can be generalized to monoidal categories, which add in parallel composition (and, with it, multiple inputs and outputs). Finally, in a symmetric monoidal category we add in the add the additional structure of the twist.”






For example, in making a hinge we may not care whether the leaf is first drilled then bent, or bent and then drilled. If we are truly indifferent to the difference between these sub-processes, we could add in the following equation to our category

In a shop with a limited number machines, this could allow a scheduler more freedom to match jobs to machines. 


Functors are mappings between categories which respect composition, and they provide the machinery needed to encode relationships between different diagrams.

To solve this problem, we propose an efficient motion planning approach for a dual-arm robot by constructing a graph repre-senting a motion sequence based on a recipe consisting of verbal instructions and cooking images. A functional unit is generated based on the linguistic instructions in the recipe. Since most recipes lack the necessary information for executing the motion, we first consider extracting the information about the cooking motion like cutting from the food images of the recipe and supplementing it. In addition, to supplement the actions that humans perform unconsciously, we generate functional units for actions not explicitly mentioned in the recipe based on the current situation of the cooking process, and then connect them to the functional units generated from the recipe. Moreover, during the connection we consider the motion of the robot's arms in parallel for an efficient execution of the recipe, similar to those of a human. Through experiments, we demonstrate that for a given recipe, the proposed method can be used to generate a cooking sequence with the supplementary information needed, and executed by a dual-arm robot. The results show that the proposed method is effective and can simplify robot teaching in cooking tasks.},

The model leverages on the strengths of both phrase-based and linguistically syntax-based method. It automatically learns aligned tree sequence pairs with mapping probabilities from word-aligned biparsed parallel texts. Compared with previous models, it not only captures non-syntactic phrases and discontinuous phrases with linguistically structured features, but also supports multi-level structure reordering of tree typology with larger span. This gives our model stronger expressive power than other reported models.

abstract = {Domain-independent probabilistic planners input an MDP description in a factored representation language such as PPDDL or RDDL, and exploit the specifics of the representation for faster planning. Traditional algorithms operate on each problem instance independently, and good methods for transferring experience from policies of other instances of a domain to a new instance do not exist. Recently, researchers have begun exploring the use of deep reactive policies, trained via deep reinforcement learning (RL), for MDP planning domains. One advantage of deep reactive policies is that they are more amenable to transfer learning. In this paper, we present the first domain-independent transfer algorithm for MDP planning domains expressed in an RDDL representation. Our architecture exploits the symbolic state configuration and transition function of the domain (available via RDDL) to learn a shared embedding space for states and state-action pairs for all problem instances of a domain. We then learn an RL agent in the embedding space, making a near zero-shot transfer possible, i.e., without much training on the new instance, and without using the domain simulator at all. Experiments on three different benchmark domains underscore the value of our transfer algorithm. Compared against planning from scratch, and a state-of-the-art RL transfer algorithm, our transfer solution has significantly superior learning curves.},

abstract = {One of the challenges of modern engineering, and robotics in particular, is designing complex systems, composed of many subsystems, rigorously and with optimality guarantees. This paper introduces a theory of co-design that describes "design problems", defined as tuples of "functionality space", "implementation space", and "resources space", together with a feasibility relation that relates the three spaces. Design problems can be interconnected together to create "co-design problems", which describe possibly recursive co-design constraints among subsystems. A co-design problem induces a family of optimization problems of the type "find the minimal resources needed to implement a given functionality"; the solution is an antichain (Pareto front) of resources. A special class of co-design problems are Monotone Co-Design Problems (MCDPs), for which functionality and resources are complete partial orders and the feasibility relation is monotone and Scott continuous. The induced optimization problems are multi-objective, nonconvex, nondifferentiable, noncontinuous, and not even defined on continuous spaces; yet, there exists a complete solution. The antichain of minimal resources can be characterized as a least fixed point, and it can be computed using Kleene's algorithm. The computation needed to solve a co-design problem can be bounded by a function of a graph property that quantifies the interdependence of the subproblems. These results make us much more optimistic about the problem of designing complex systems in a rigorous way.},

In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based robot motion planning framework that uses implicit behavior cloning (IBC) and dynamic movement primitive (DMP) to improve the training speed and generalizability of an off-policy RL agent. IBC utilizes human demonstration data to leverage the training speed of RL, and DMP serves as a heuristic model that transfers motion planning into a simpler planning space. To support this, we also create a human demonstration dataset using a pick-and-place experiment that can be used for similar studies. Comparison studies in simulation reveal the advantage of the proposed method over the conventional RL agents with faster training speed and higher scores. A real-robot experiment indicates the applicability of the proposed method to a simple assembly task. Our work provides a novel perspective on using motion primitives and human demonstration to leverage the performance of RL for robot applications.},

First, we will demonstrate the power and flexibility of conceptual modeling techniques based on a branch of mathematics called category theory (CT), using the structure of Carnatic music as an example. Second, we describe a platform for collaboration and research sharing in this area. The construction of this platform uses formal methods of CT (colimits) to merge our Carnatic ontology with a generic model of music information retrieval tasks. The latter model allows us to integrate multiple analytical methods, such as hidden Markov models, machine learning algorithms, and other data mining techniques like clustering, bagging, etc., in the analysis of a variety of different musical features. Furthermore, the framework facilitates the storage of musical performances based on the proposed ontology, making them available for additional analysis and integration. The proposed framework is extensible, allowing future work in the area of rāga recognition to build on our results, thereby facilitating collaborative research. Generally speaking, the methods presented here are intended as an exemplar for designing collaborative frameworks supporting reproducibility of computational analysis and simulation.},

"One shortcoming of existing ontological approaches is alack of extensibility. It can be difficult to modify an existingontology in order to extend or debug its domain. In particu-lar, it is difficult to relate different ontologies to one another,particularly in cases where neither ontology embeds into theother. A lack of formal relationships between ontologies also leads to difficulties when migrating data from one ontology toanother."

Through ontology and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules, the robot infers the tasks to be performed according to the environment state and at the same time obtains the semantic information of the victims.

We consider using homomorphic encryption (HE) scheme, which enables cloud computing platforms to perform arithmetic operations without decrypting ciphertexts. Using the HE scheme, users are allowed to deliver only ciphertexts to the cloud computing platform for using RL-based services. We propose a privacy-preserving reinforcement learning (PPRL) framework for the cloud computing platform.

We devise algorithms that, given a planning problem supplemented with an information stipulation, can find a plan, associated disclosure policy, or both jointly, if and only if some exists.

abstract = {Hierarchies are one of the most common structures used to understand and conceptualise the world. Within the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning, which deals with the automation of world-relevant problems, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is the branch that represents and handles hierarchies. In particular, the requirement for rich domain knowledge to characterise the world enables HTN planning to be very useful, and also to perform well. However, the history of almost 40 years obfuscates the current understanding of HTN planning in terms of accomplishments, planning models, similarities and differences among hierarchical planners, and its current and objective image. On top of these issues, the ability of hierarchical planning to truly cope with the requirements of real-world applications has been often questioned. As a remedy, we propose a framework-based approach where we first provide a basis for defining different formal models of hierarchical planning, and define two models that comprise a large portion of HTN planners. Second, we provide a set of concepts that helps in interpreting HTN planners from the aspect of their search space. Then, we analyse and compare the planners based on a variety of properties organised in five segments, namely domain authoring, expressiveness, competence, computation and applicability. Furthermore, we select Web service composition as a real-world and current application, and classify and compare the approaches that employ HTN planning to solve the problem of service composition. Finally, we conclude with our findings and present directions for future work. In summary, we provide a novel and comprehensive viewpoint on a core AI planning technique.},

abstract = {Our work focuses on modeling security of systems from their component-level designs. Towards this goal we develop a categorical formalism to model attacker actions. Equipping the categorical formalism with algebras produces two interesting results for security modeling. First, using the Yoneda lemma, we are able to model attacker reconnaissance missions. In this context, the Yoneda lemma formally shows us that if two system representations, one being complete and the other being the attacker's incomplete view, agree at every possible test, then they behave the same. The implication is that attackers can still successfully exploit the system even with incomplete information. Second, we model the possible changes that can occur to the system via an exploit. An exploit either manipulates the interactions between system components, for example, providing the wrong values to a sensor, or changes the components themselves, for example, manipulating the firmware of a global positioning system (GPS). One additional benefit of using category theory is that mathematical operations can be represented as formal diagrams, which is useful for applying this analysis in a model-based design setting. We illustrate this modeling framework using a cyber-physical system model of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We demonstrate and model two types of attacks (1) a rewiring attack, which violates data integrity, and (2) a rewriting attack, which violates availability.},
annote = {Modeling how attackers are able to successful craft exploits with incomplete information about the system.. Okay, cool.. But how do we stop them?

Two types of attacks will be modeled:
1) rewiring - violating data integrity
2) rewriting - violates availability

[Introduction]
Areas in science of security that need innovation [3]:
- metrics
- formal methods
- experimentation

Currently, security is *not* seen as a modeling problem. This needs to change [4], [5], [6].

Objective: develop a formal method for component-level modeling of attacker actions. 

Two systems that have differences in architectural implementations but agree on every "test" are behaviorally equivalent.

**What's a test??**
**There is a distinction between behavior and architectural. **behavior:architecture::operad:operad algebra (?)**
**How to prove two systems are equivalent and some empirical examples of this being so.. Real-world examples of yoneda hacking would be interesting...**

[9]

System behavior is related to system architecture by decomposition rules

no common language for security [22]
**reminds me of exploit factory**

Yoneda lemma can be used to infer similarities between systems based on the similarities of their test outcomes (??)

[11]

[Problem Formulation]
Two phases an attacker goes through:
Phase 1 Learning: gathering information about the system and finding vulnerabilities
Phase 2 Hijacking: leveraging a weakness to change the behavior of the system

**Modeling architecture to compute metrics about it i.e. the amount of data needed, the "complexity", the number of modules**

**Same automata implemented in different ways are equivalent up to isomorphism. The attacker can figure out the exact stuff to do provided the generic roadmap. Helps the attacker know what to look for.**

[Categorial Preliminaries]
You will need the following for the compositional framework for cyber security:
- a compositional system model in the wiring diagram category
- Yoneda lemma: "fully determines" an object by it's relationships (tests)
- functors + natural transformations to understand the impact of an exploit on the system

**Thesis topic: build a software system entirely from categorical terms**

Assumption: a CPS model built in categorical terms already exists (author acknowledges that this is likely not the case)

general theory for systems-as-algebras [35]

We need to move towards a formal treatment of systems modeling **yes! formal treatment of software modeling at the design stage**

**Yoneda lemma?? idgi**

We can completely characterize (?) and object by its images onto Set

W, the category of wiring diagrams
Objects := pairs of sets ({input things}, {output things})
Morphisms := encapsulation of boxes inside other boxes, nested boxes 

**Every single little translation is captured**
F: W -> Cat
Functor from wiring diagram to any category assigning behavior to boxes, handles the morphisms by mapping to tthings that handle composite systems in the target category

abstract = {Due to a general shift in manufacturing paradigm from mass production towards mass customization, reconfigurable automation technologies, such as robots, are required. However, current industrial robot solutions are notoriously difficult to program, leading to high changeover times when new products are introduced by manufacturers. In order to compete on global markets, the factories of tomorrow need complete production lines, including automation technologies that can effortlessly be reconfigured or repurposed, when the need arises. In this paper we present the concept of general, self-asserting robot skills for manufacturing. We show how a relatively small set of skills are derived from current factory worker instructions, and how these can be transferred to industrial mobile manipulators. General robot skills can not only be implemented on these robots, but also be intuitively concatenated to program the robots to perform a variety of tasks, through the use of simple task-level programming methods. We demonstrate various approaches to this, extensively tested with several people inexperienced in robotics. We validate our findings through several deployments of the complete robot system in running production facilities at an industrial partner. It follows from these experiments that the use of robot skills, and associated task-level programming framework, is a viable solution to introducing robots that can intuitively and on the fly be programmed to perform new tasks by factory workers.},

For assembly sequence planning, a new assembly planning system has been developed and evaluated with several representative assembly groups. As an interface to robot control systems, manipulation primitives have been introduced. Manipulation primitive nets are an appropriate way to deal with uncertainties occurring during assembly task execution. This contribution introduces a new approach, demonstrating how to generate manipulation primitive nets automatically. Firstly, CAD data are segmented into surface primitives. A contact formation graph based on topological contacts between such surface primitives is generated afterwards. Based on these contact formation graphs, manipulation primitive nets can be successfully derived. The concept for automated robot programming presented in this contribution is supported by real experiments of actual assembly tasks.},

abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning has achieved great success in many challenging domains. However, sample efficiency and safety issues still prevent from applying deep reinforcement learning directly in robotics. Sim-to-real transfer learning is one feasible solution to tackle these problems and address the reality gap between simulation and reality. In this letter, we propose to combine meta-reinforcement learning and progressive neural network (PNN) by meta-training a policy for multiple source tasks and transferring it to the real-world robot via PNN (MetaPNN). We expect that training meta-policy over meta-tasks without considering dynamics discrepancy with our method can bridge the gap between simulation and reality with mismatched dynamics, and allow the agent to learn one single policy solving multiple tasks instead of using one policy network in PNN to solve one task. Meanwhile, the transferred meta-policy via PNN is expected to solve the target task and adapt to new situations at the same time. Our results in a variety of target tasks in AntPos and Reach with simulated manipulator show that MetaPNN can significantly improve the robot's learning efficiency and performance. Our further results in real-world Reach tasks with physical robot arm and a new task that is different from the meta-tasks show there might be a synergy between meta-learning and PNN.},

Formulating models which use axioms can sometimes result in problems with much smaller search spaces than the original model. We propose a method for automatically extracting a particular class of axioms from standard STRIPS PDDL models. More specifically, we identify operators whose effects become irrelevant given some other operator, and generate axioms that capture this relationship. We show that this algorithm can be used to successfully extract axioms from standard IPC benchmark instances, and show that the extracted axioms can be used to significantly improve the performance of satisficing planners.},

Its flexibility enhances cognitive simulation studies by simplifying experimentation. Furthermore, SME is very efficient, making it a useful component in machine learning systems as well. We review the structure-mapping theory and describe the design of the engine. We analyze the complexity of the algorithm, and demonstrate that most of the steps are polynomial, typically bounded by O(N2). Next we demonstrate some examples of its operation taken from our cognitive simulation studies and work in machine learning. Finally, we compare SME to other analogy programs and discuss several areas for future work. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

Currently one of the most popular and successful algorithmic techniques in STRIPS planning is to guide search by a heuristic function, where the heuristic is based on relaxing the planning task by ignoring the delete lists of the available actions. We present a natural extension of "ignoring delete lists" to numeric state variables, preserving the relevant theoretical properties of the STRIPS relaxation under the condition that the numeric task at hand is "monotonic". We then identify a subset of the numeric IPC-3 competition language, "linear tasks", where monotonicity can be achieved by pre-processing. Based on that, we extend the algorithms used in the heuristic planning system FF to linear tasks. The resulting system Metric-FF is, according to the IPC-3 results which we discuss, one of the two currently most efficient numeric planners. {\textcopyright} 2003 AI Access Foundation.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel system that allows to generate variants of industrial robot programs. Such a system is widely needed in different areas of application. First, product scenarios change often slightly and thereby cause high programming costs. Using our system reduces these costs, because non-specialists can create a specific program variant by themselves. Second, an engineer needs numerous program variants to find an optimized cell layout, e.g. regarding robot execution time. Present systems require too much manual effort and they are very limited in considering application-specific requirements. Consequently, we have implemented a system that contains an interpreter to execute user-defined scripts. A script contains the information on how to generate the program variants. Each change of the parameter values inside the script results in a different program. We simulate the program execution and use the simulation results to further improve the programs. We prove the usefulness of our system by industrial applications.},
annote = {This paper provides a system that generates robot program variants in controller-specific syntax. 

The requirements of a system that generates robot program variants:
1. Be able to extract geometric information
2. Be able to define algorithms that operate on geometric information
3. Must include a controller independent specification of the desired sequence of robot commands (**i.e. task-based language**)
4. Be able to test programs in simulation environment
5. Have an open interface to allow extending the system

The generator system contains (4) layers:
* Application layer
- Contains input assistant that allows the user to generate one specific program variant
- Another part to generate all possible program variants which includes information like:
$\sim$ generation plans: script that contains all commands to generate the program variants
$\sim$ syntax definition (e.g. for KUKA KRL or MELFA BASIC)
$\sim$ technology package (e.g. KUKA ArcTech and ABB ArcWare)
* Generation layer
- Generation controller: execute generation plan
- Program synthesis: reads the syntax definition and incorporates the program from the generation controller to create controller specific program
* Simulation layer
- Simulation model: contains the geometric information of work cell
- Virtual robot controller: take controller specific program and executes
- Simulation results
* Manufacturing layer (on real hardware)


More about the generation plans:
Plan language included with this paper. Requirements of the generation plan are:
- Plan variables (data types and map to syntax)
- Plan steps (define instructions using plan variables)

To apply the generation plan to a problem, you must describe in the plan:
- Variables containing geometric information
- Plan steps to calculate things from the geometric information
- Sequence of instructions to execute

After generating the robot program, the program is executed in simulation and checked for collisions, etc.

abstract = {Solving realistic robotic task planning problems is computationally demanding. To better exploit the planning effort and reduce the future planning cost, it is important to increase the reusability of successful plans. To this end, we suggest a systematic and automatable approach for plan transfer, by rethinking the plan caching procedure. Specifically, instead of caching successful plans in their original domain, we suggest transferring them upon discovery to a dynamically-defined abstract domain and cache them as “abstract skills” there. This technique allows us to maintain a unified, standardized, and compact skill database, to avoid skill redundancy, and to support lifelong operation. Cached skills can later be reconstructed into new domains on demand, and be applied to new tasks, with no human intervention. This is made possible thanks to the novel concept of “abstraction keys.” An abstraction key, when coupled with a skill, provides all the necessary information to cache it, reconstruct it, and transfer it across all domains in which it is applicable—even domains we have yet to encounter. We practically demonstrate the approach by providing two examples of such keys and explain how they can be used in a manipulation planning domain.},

Consistency between design and implementation is hard to 
achieve.

[Communicating Sequence Processes]
Process algebra is an algebra describing communicating processes.
CSP models concurrent systems by events.
[6], [7]

process = (alphabet, failures, divergences)
failures = {(trace, set of refusal events offered by environment)}

operations between processes:
* sequence 
* deterministic choice 
* non-deterministic choice
* parallel execution
* recursion

Process algebra is used to compose concurrent processes in software systems using process-oriented programming.

[Category Theory]
computer science [15], software engineering [16], [18] to formalize refinement from design to implementation

CT can model models of concurrency such as transition systems, trace languages, event structures, petri nets

[The categorical framework]
RQ1: In design, how can we use CT to model processes and how they communicate?
RQ2: In implementation, how can we use CT to model processes and how they communicate?
RQ3: How can we use CT to validate consistency between the design and implementation CT model

[Example]
A customer buys from a vending machine with a coin and it returns tea or coffee

Symbols/alphabet = {coin, tea, coffee}
Failures =
* no coin --> no tea or coffee
* provide a coin --> coin is returned
* provide coin, request tea --> ??
* provide coin, request coffee --> ??

--Categorification--
consistency means every sequence in the design has a correspondence to every sequence in the implementation
This consistency is checked using category theory in [4], [5]. Verifies this by successful construction of the functor.

abstract = {Due to their advantages, there is an increase of applying robotic systems for small batch production as well as for complex manufacturing processes. However, programming and configuring robots is time and resource consuming while being also accompanied by high costs that are especially challenging for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The current way of programming industrial robots by using teach-in control devices and/or using vendor-specific programming languages is in general a complex activity that requires extensive knowledge in the robotics domain. It is therefore important to offer new practical methods for the programming of industrial robots that provide flexibility and versatility in order to achieve feasible robotics solutions for small lot size productions. This paper focuses on the development of a knowledge-driven framework, which should overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art robotics solutions and enhance the agility and autonomy of industrial robotics systems using ontologies as a knowledge-source. The framework includes reasoning and perception abilities as well as the ability to generate plans, select appropriate actions, and finally execute these actions. In this context, a challenge is the fusion of vision system information with the decision-making component, which can use this information for generating the assembly tasks and executable programs. The introduced product model in the form of an ontology enables that the framework can semantically link perception data to product models to consequently derive handling operations and required tools. Besides, the framework enables an easier adaption of robot-based production systems for individualized production, which requires swift configuration and efficient planning. The presented approach is demonstrated in a laboratory environment with an industrial pilot test case. Our application shows the potential to reduce the efforts needed to program robots in an automated production environment. In this context, the benefits as well as shortcomings of the approach are also discussed in the paper.},

The two main branches of algorithms to generate policies automatically, automated planning and machine learning, both have their own drawbacks and have not previously been combined for generation of BTs. We propose a method for creating BTs by combining these branches, inserting the result of an automated planner into the population of a Genetic Programming algorithm. Experiments confirm that the proposed method performs well on a variety of robotic assembly problems and outperforms the base methods used separately.

Our approach addresses the question about how to reason about symbolic and continuous knowledge jointly. By encoding continuous knowledge, such as position and rotation as attributes, we can incorporate physics and motion models as expressions. While at the same time, manipulating predicates in the same action. For example, if we wish for a robot gripper to drop an object, the symbolic knowledge of robot_is_holding=nothing is updated at the same time the position of the dropped object is computed.

The question is how can both task and motion planners be adapted to make use of the categorical database representation. Forward planning has been demonstrated in this work. 

Another benefit is that natural transformations ensure that the state update is well-defined and the schema is adhered to.},

abstract = {Automated planning is a prominent Artificial Intelligence challenge, as well as being a common capability requirement for intelligent autonomous agents. A critical aspect of what is called domainindependent planning, is the application knowledge that must be added to the planner to create a complete planning application. This is made explicit in (i) a domain model, which is a formal representation of the persistent domain knowledge, and (ii) an associated problem instance, containing the details of the particular problem to be solved. Both these components are used by automated planning engines for reasoning, in order to synthesize a solution plan. Formulating knowledge for use in planning engines is currently something of an ad-hoc process, where the skills of knowledge engineers significantly influence the quality of the resulting planning application. On top of that, a notion of quality of the knowledge captured within a domain model is missing; it is therefore hard to provide useful guidelines to knowledge engineers. This paper raises some issues relating to the engineering of application knowledge for automated planning, focussing on the domain model. It uses the idea of a domain model as a formal specification of a domain, and considers what it means to measure the quality of such a specification. To do this it proposes definitions of the attributes of a domain model and its encoding language, which are needed by the automated planning community in order to improve tools for supporting the engineering of planning knowledge, and to advance toward a shared and inclusive definition of quality of domain models.},

abstract = {Most commercial manufacturers of industrial robots require their robots to be programmed in a proprietary language tailored to the domain - a typical domain-specific language (DSL). However, these languages oftentimes suffer from shortcomings such as controller-specific design, limited expressiveness and a lack of extensibility. For that reason, we developed the extensible Robotics API for programming industrial robots on top of a general-purpose language. Although being a very flexible approach to programming industrial robots, a fully-fledged language can be too complex for simple tasks. Additionally, legacy support for code written in the original DSL has to be maintained. For these reasons, we present a lightweight implementation of a typical robotic DSL, the KUKA Robot Language (KRL), on top of our Robotics API. This work deals with the challenges in reverse-engineering the language and mapping its specifics to the Robotics API. We introduce two different approaches of interpreting and executing KRL programs: tree-based and bytecode-based interpretation.},
annote = {The authors developed a general purpose language for robotic programming, SoftRobot Robotics API. They want to maintain the code written in a robotic DSL, i.e. KUKA, by defining maps from KUKA to the Robotics API.

[Problems with DSL]
- Not extensible. Tailored to the robot controller so the instruction set is specific to the hardware
- Cannot extend instructions to do more novel or challenging things, e.g. coordination of multiple robots

[KUKA Language]
- Imperative + robot specific statements
- Has two program counters to anticipate motion plans ahead of the current execution
- Types: INT, REAL, BOOL, CHAR, Arrays, Struct, AXIS (Struct), POS (Struct)
- Robot-specific statements: PTP (point-to-point), LIN (linear motion)

[Approach]
* Successful reimplmentation must:
- retain control flow
- robot movements are planned the same
- robot movements are executed thes same

Read the KRL user manual (not specification or grammar is provided). The allowed parameters were vague in the manual (***challenges**)

A KUKA grammar was made using the user manual, sample KRL code, and checking in KUKA.OfficeLite

Given a KRL program, it was:
1) parsed to generate an AST
2) parsed to generate hierarchical symbol table (for scoping)

abstract = {We present a framework for learning to plan hierarchically in domains with unknown dynamics. We enhance planning performance by exploiting problem structure in several ways: First, we simplify the search over plans by leveraging knowledge of skill objectives; second, shorter plans are generated by enforcing aggressively hierarchical planning; and third, we learn transition dynamics with sparse local models for better generalization. Our framework decomposes transition dynamics into skill effects and success conditions, which allows fast planning by reasoning on effects, while learning conditions from interactions with the world. We propose a simple method for learning new abstract skills, using successful trajectories stemming from completing the goals of a curriculum. Learned skills are then refined to leverage other abstract skills and enhance subsequent planning. We show that both conditions and abstract skills can be learned simultaneously while planning, even in stochastic domains. Our method is validated in experiments of increasing complexity, with up to 2{100} states, showing superior planning to classic non-hierarchical planners or reinforcement learning methods. Applicability to real-world problems is demonstrated in a simulation-to-real transfer experiment on a robotic manipulator.},

First, Two kinds of data are generated by Natural Language Processing module from the speech: (i) action frames and their relationships; (ii) the modifier used to indicate some property or characteristic of a variable in the action frame. Next, the task's goals are generated from these action frames and modifiers. These goals are represented as AI symbols, combining world state and domain knowledge, which are used to generate plans by an Answer Set Programming solver. Finally, the plan's actions are executed one by one, and continuous sensing grounds useful information, which makes the robot use contingent knowledge to adapt to dynamic changes and faults. For each action in the plan, the planner gets its preconditions and effects from domain knowledge, so during the execution of the task, the environmental changes, especially those conflict with the actions, not only the action being performed but also the subsequent actions, can be detected and handled as early as possible. A series of case studies are used to evaluate the system and verify its ability to acquire knowledge through dialogue with users, solve problems with the acquired causal knowledge, and plan for complex tasks autonomously in the open world.},

With a terminology of tasks and object-centered skills, industrial applications are analyzed in the logistic and assistive domains. The analysis shows that many tasks can actually be solved with a small library of predefined building blocks, called skills. In logistics domains, it can be exploited that the sequences of skills needed to solve specific tasks follow certain patterns, whereas in assistive tasks, the sequence vary a lot, and tasks must be taught to the robot by a user, based on Standard Operating Procedures or process knowledge. An overview is presented on how to implement a skill-based architecture, enabling reuse of skills for different industrial applications, programmed by shop-floor workers. The terminology of tasks, skills, and motion primitives is introduced and designed to separate responsibilities of robot system developers, robot system integrators and shop floor users concerning programming of the robot system. The concept of testable pre- and postconditions assigned to the skills are proposed to help both in developing skills and asserting when a skill is applicable.},

Off-the-shelf task planners can be used by intelligent robotics practitioners to solve a variety of planning problems. However, many different planners exist, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and there are no general rules for which planner would be best to apply to a given problem. In this study, we empirically compare the performance of state-of-the-art planners that use either the planning domain description language (PDDL) or answer set programming (ASP) as the underlying action language. PDDL is designed for task planning, and PDDL-based planners are widely used for a variety of planning problems. ASP is designed for knowledge-intensive reasoning, but can also be used to solve task planning problems. Given domain encodings that are as similar as possible, we find that PDDL-based planners perform better on problems with longer solutions, and ASP-based planners are better on tasks with a large number of objects or tasks in which complex reasoning is required to reason about action preconditions and effects. The resulting analysis can inform selection among general-purpose planning systems for particular robot task planning domains.},

annote = {SUMMARY 

The paper presents an approach to integrate AI planning technologies with robotic applications using a domain-independent task representation language TAEMS aimed at combining high-level deliberation with low-level uncertainty. Some notable features of TAEMS are:

* The ability to aggregate probabilistic quality, cost, and duration scores after a task or subtask has been completed. The authors state that these semantics for these scores can be assigned domain-specific meaning at the time of modeling.
* The addition of non-local effects which act as constraints between subtasks and methods which loosens the underlying data structure from a tree to a directed graph. 

The paper also introduces domain-independent tools that can generate a schedule of executable methods for the robot and handle necessary collaboration with other robots based on TAEMS framework. Provided this representation, the an intelligent scheduler would be responsible for choosing which among multiple schedules (plans) within the task network optimizes quality, cost, and/or duration. The drawback to this approach is that the modeling of the task network would not be provided automatically, but would instead require a user to model it.

The paper also discusses the challenges of integrating high-level reasoning and low-level functional behaviors for the robot, such as when to interrupt, replan, or communicate. The paper also describes a platform for developing software agents using TAEMS and testing them in a simulated environment with real-world physics, using JADE framework and LibGDX library.


STRENGTHS 

* Clarity of writing: The figures were very nicely generated. Figure 2 along with the written explanation was particularly helpful for understanding the TAEMS representation.
* Research Contribution: The addition of non-local effects is beneficial for modeling dependencies between subtasks and methods. They are effectively encoding the success of previous methods as preconditions for other subtasks and methods.
* Claims: The discussion regarding the robot control challenges for high-level and low-level controller integration provide accurate expositions with good examples.

WEAKNESSES

* Clarity of writing: There are a few typos that were found upon reading the paper:
- Page 2 (TAEMS Formal Representation of Tasks and Environment): "TAEMS example in graphically in" --> "TAEMS example graphically in"
- Page 6 (Conclusion and Future Work): "Robotcup resue" --> "RoboCup Rescue" (?)
* Potential for Impact/Usefulness: This appears to be another syntactic formalism for modeling hierarchical task plans with some extensions, such as the addition of non-local effects. With each added feature, the complexity of the scheduling algorithm could increase. This paper could be improved by answering questions, such as how would existing or novel planners use this representation? What AI technologies would they use? The specific AI technologies are not mentioned in the paper.
* Claims: This paper begs a few clarifying details about the scheduler that are preventing the novel contributions from being pronounced. When does the quality, cost, and duration get updated? Do these values can computed at execution time, or does the scheduler assign expected values for these attributes and then passes along this task plan for execution? Additionally, how does the task network get updated if other subtasks and methods need to be introduced? More emphasis could have been placed on these details and less on the high-level to low-level controller integration and simulator. These are known problems that the novel task representation language is not directly addressing these issues in this paper.},

abstract = {The ultimate objective in planning is to construct plans for execution. However, when a plan is executed in a real environment it can encounter differences between the expected and actual context of execution. These differences can manifest as divergences between the expected and observed states of the world, or as a change in the goals to be achieved by the plan. In both cases, the old plan must be replaced with a new one. In replacing the plan an important consideration is plan stability. We compare two alternative strategies for achieving the stable repair of a plan: one is simply to replan from scratch and the other is to adapt the existing plan to the new context. We present arguments to support the claim that plan stability is a valuable property. We then propose an implementation, based on LPG, of a plan repair strategy that adapts a plan to its new context. We demonstrate empirically that our plan repair strategy achieves more stability than replanning and can produce repaired plans more efficiently than replanning.

abstract = {The research and development of intelligent automation solutions is a ground-breaking point for the factory of the future. A promising and challenging mission is the use of autonomous robot systems to automate tasks in the field of maintenance. For this purpose, the robot system must be able to plan autonomously the different manipulation tasks and the corresponding paths. Basic requirements are the development of algorithms with a low computational complexity and the possibility to deal with environmental uncertainties. In this paper, an approach is presented, which is especially suited to solve the problem of maintenance automation. For this purpose, offline data from CAD is combined with online data from an RGBD vision system via a probabilistic filter, to compensate uncertainties from offline data. For planning the different tasks, a method is explained, which uses a symbolic description, founded on a novel sampling-based method to compute the disassembly space. For path planning, we use global state-of-the-art algorithms with a method that allows the adaption of the exploration stepsize in order to reduce the planning time. Every method is experimentally validated and discussed. Note to Practitioners - This paper was motivated by the current deficit to automate maintenance tasks in manufacturing systems. Today there exist many automatic methods for fault detection, but there is no possibility to restore the desired state. A typical application is the replacement of a defective component or service tasks such as refilling of cooling lubricant in machine tools. The focus of this paper is to provide automatic planning concepts for robot systems which deal with this problem. For this, a task planning algorithm is proposed which uses CAD and vision data. The advantage of this method is that it works on a contact analysis, based on a discrete approximation of the disassembly space, allowing a fast determination of possible robot manipulations. Also, a new preprocessing concept for path planning is developed which enables the adaptation of the stepsize of the path planner, based on the local occupancy of the environment. Through this, it is possible to drastically reduce the required planning effort.},

However, typical 3DSGs contain hundreds of objects and symbols even for small environments; rendering task planning on the full graph impractical. We construct TASKOGRAPHY, the first large-scale robotic task planning benchmark over 3DSGs. While most benchmarking efforts in this area focus on vision-based planning, we systematically study symbolic planning, to decouple planning performance from visual representation learning. We observe that, among existing methods, neither classical nor learning-based planners are capable of real-time planning over full 3DSGs. Enabling real-time planning demands progress on both (a) sparsifying 3DSGs for tractable planning and (b) designing planners that better exploit 3DSG hierarchies. Towards the former goal, we propose SCRUB, a task-conditioned 3DSG sparsification method; enabling classical planners to match and in some cases surpass state-of-the-art learning-based planners. Towards the latter goal, we propose SEEK, a procedure enabling learning-based planners to exploit 3DSG structure, reducing the number of replanning queries required by current best approaches by an order of magnitude. We will open-source all code and baselines to spur further research along the intersections of robot task planning, learning and 3DSGs.},

While used success-fully in standard (quantitative) sensors, we are developing this methodology in new directions to make it appropriate specifically for semantic information sources, including keyterms, ontology terms, and other general Boolean, categorical, ordinal, and partially-ordered data types. Given pairwise information source integration principles, TDM can measure overall consistency, and most importantly, reveal cyclic dependencies amongst data sources where conflicts might not be able to be identified. We illustrate the basics of the methodology in an extended use case/example, and discuss path forward.},

abstract = {This book is open access under a CC BY 4.0 license. This book bridges the gap between playing with robots in school and studying robotics at the upper undergraduate and graduate levels to prepare for careers in industry and research. Robotic algorithms are presented formally, but using only mathematics known by high-school and first-year college students, such as calculus, matrices and probability. Concepts and algorithms are explained through detailed diagrams and calculations. Elements of Robotics presents an overview of different types of robots and the components used to build robots, but focuses on robotic algorithms: simple algorithms like odometry and feedback control, as well as algorithms for advanced topics like localization, mapping, image processing, machine learning and swarm robotics. These algorithms are demonstrated in simplified contexts that enable detailed computations to be performed and feasible activities to be posed. Students who study these simplified demonstrations will be well prepared for advanced study of robotics. The algorithms are presented at a relatively abstract level, not tied to any specific robot. Instead a generic robot is defined that uses elements common to most educational robots: differential drive with two motors, proximity sensors and some method of displaying output to the use. The theory is supplemented with over 100 activities, most of which can be successfully implemented using inexpensive educational robots. Activities that require more computation can be programmed on a computer. Archives are available with suggested implementations for the Thymio robot and standalone programs in Python.},

The main contribution of this work is to extend our behavior-based approach by two generalizations in the task representation model, which were identified in previous work, but not yet examined. With this we introduce novel extensions of our programming paradigm by integrating task generalization in terms of path adaption and object generalization. The proposed extensions allow to generalize task solutions from a demonstration by monitoring resources (e.g. objects in the workspace) and their changes. Integrating task generalization by adapting a demonstrated task to new paths as well as new objects in similar situations raises challenges for both, demonstration and execution phase: During task demonstration it is necessary to identify which aspects can be generalized and during execution we have to distinguish adaptable from faulty situations.},

Robot software is like a cyber-physical systems with new characteristics such as:
- Managing control with physical equipment and devices
- Dealing with non-functional requirements like real-time, security, safety
- Autonomous and self-adaptive because the environments are often open systems

Development of robotic programming languages began in 1973 up to present day.

Phase I (1970 - 1980) required:
* Establishing specific mechanisms for accurate control and error recovery
* Support sensory feedback in assembly operations

Phase II (1990s) required:
* Flexible mobility inspired by bionic and autonomy
* High-level programming approach for advance robot tasks
* Specification for behavior pattern to mimic adaptation

Phase III (2000-present) require:
* Use logic-based reasoning methods for task planning and decision-making
* Use agent-oriented techniques to program multiple robots at once

New challenges include:
* Communication mechanisms for distributed control for robot swarms
* Interoperability and portability of programs between different robot hardware platforms
* Autonomous or self-adaptive robot software needs methods to improve software dynamism and changeability
* Improve programming frameworks to promote resuability and well-structure programs},

These actions must be both optimal with respect to a specified objective and satisfy whatever constraints exist in their world. We propose an approach for robot task planning that is capable of planning the optimal sequence of grounded actions to accomplish a task given a specific objective function while satisfying all specified numerical constraints. Our approach accomplishes this by encoding the entire task planning problem as a single mixed integer convex program, which it then solves using an off-the-shelf Mixed Integer Program-ming solver. We evaluate our approach on several mobile manipulation tasks in both simulation and on a physical humanoid robot. Our approach is able to consistently produce optimal plans while accounting for all specified numerical constraints in the mobile manipulation tasks.

abstract = {Robot software systems tend to be complex. This complexity is due, in large part, to the need to control diverse sensors and actuators in real time, in the face of significant uncertainty and noise. Robot systems must work to achieve tasks while monitoring for, and reacting to, unexpected situations. Doing all this concurrently and asynchronously adds immensely to system complexity. The use of a well-conceived architecture, together with programming tools that support the architecture, can often help to manage that complexity. Currently, there is no single architecture that is best for all applications – different architectures have different advantages and disadvantages. It is important to understand those strengths and weaknesses when choosing an architectural approach for a given application. This chapter presents various approaches to architecting robotic systems. It starts by defining terms and setting the context, including a recounting of the historical developments in the area of robot architectures. The chapter then discusses in more depth the major types of architectural components in use today – behavioral control (Chap. 38), executives, and task planners (Chap. 9) – along with commonly used techniques for interconnecting connecting those components. Throughout, emphasis will be placed on programming tools and environments that support these architectures. A case study is then presented, followed by a brief discussion of further reading.},

While there has been exciting progress in this direction, most of the approaches still require a few hundred tasks for meta-training, which limits the scalability of the approaches. Our main contribution is to formulate one-shot imitation learning as a symbolic planning problem along with the symbol grounding problem. This formulation disentangles the policy execution from the inter-task generalization and leads to better data efficiency. The key technical challenge is that the symbol grounding is prone to error with limited training data and leads to subsequent symbolic planning failures. We address this challenge by proposing a continuous relaxation of the discrete symbolic planner that directly plans on the probabilistic outputs of the symbol grounding model. Our continuous relaxation of the planner can still leverage the information contained in the probabilistic symbol grounding and significantly improve over the baseline planner for the one-shot imitation learning tasks without using large training data.},

In this problem, we consider two types of generalizations: to previously unseen instructions and to longer sequences of instructions. For generalization over unseen instructions, we propose a new objective which encourages learning correspondences between similar subtasks by making analogies. For generalization over sequential instructions, we present a hierarchical architecture where a meta controller learns to use the acquired skills for executing the instructions. To deal with delayed reward, we propose a new neural architecture in the meta controller that learns when to update the subtask, which makes learning more efficient. Experimental results on a stochastic 3D domain show that the proposed ideas are crucial for generalization to longer instructions as well as unseen instructions.},

abstract = {Classical planning tasks are usually modeled in the PDDL which is a schematic language based on first-order logic. Nevertheless, most of the current planners turn this first-order representation into a propositional one via the grounding process. It is well known that the grounding process may cause an exponential blowup. Therefore it is important to detect which grounded atoms are redundant in a sense that they are not necessary for finding a plan and therefore the grounding process does not need to generate them. This is usually done by a relaxed reachability analysis, which can be improved by employing structural symmetries. Symmetries are bijective self-maps preserving the structure of the PDDL task. In this paper, we introduce a new method which is based on self-maps preserving the structure but which need not be bijective. We call these maps PDDL endomorphisms and we show that they can be used for pruning of redundant objects even if they appear in a reachable atom. We formulate the computation of endomorphisms as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that can be solved by an off-the-shelf CSP solver.},

abstract = {Coalgebra offers a unified theory of state based systems, including infinite streams, labelled transition systems and deterministic automata. In this paper, we use the coalgebraic view on systems to derive, in a uniform way, abstract procedures for checking behavioural equivalence in coalgebras, which perform (a combination of) minimization and determinization. First, we show that for coalgebras in categories equipped with factorization structures, there exists an abstract procedure for equivalence checking. Then, we consider coalgebras in categories without suitable factorization structures: under certain conditions, it is possible to apply the above procedure after transforming coalgebras with reflections. This transformation can be thought of as some kind of determinization. We will apply our theory to the following examples: conditional transition systems and (non-deterministic) automata. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools used to build robotic systems. ROS is known for a distributed and modular design. Given a model of the environment, task planning is concerned with the assembly of actions into a structure that is predicted to achieve goals. This can be done in a way that minimises costs, such as time or energy. Task planning is vital in directing the actions of a robotic agent in domains where a causal chain could lock the agent into a dead-end state. Moreover, planning can be used in less constrained domains to provide more intelligent behaviour. This paper describes the ROSPlan framework, an architecture for embedding task planning into ROS systems. We provide a description of the architecture and a case study in autonomous robotics. Our case study involves autonomous underwater vehicles in scenarios that demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of our approach.},

My thesis is concerned with domain knowledge representation for planning and will solve the problem of interactively reasoning about affordances and replanning in robotics. 

HTNs encode hierararchy of actions, but don't relate back to a knowledge-base for the states. We desire a functorial relationship between plan execution and knowledge base updates. An affordance relation is one that connects the world to its specific actions.

If action schemas are only considered with the type of knowledge and a sequence of actions can be identified with one instance, then actions can be found with other instances assuming they have the same type.},

abstract = {In his 1986 Automatica paper Willems introduced the influential behavioural approach to control theory with an investigation of linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete dynamical systems. The behavioural approach places open systems at its centre, modelling by tearing, zooming, and linking. We show that these ideas are naturally expressed in the language of symmetric monoidal categories. Our main result gives an intuitive sound and fully complete string diagram algebra for reasoning about LTI systems. These string diagrams are closely related to the classical notion of signal flow graphs, endowed with semantics as multi-input multi-output transducers that process discrete streams with an infinite past as well as an infinite future. At the categorical level, the algebraic characterisation is that of the prop of corelations. Using this framework, we derive a novel structural characterisation of controllability, and consequently provide a methodology for analysing controllability of networked and interconnected systems. We argue that this has the potential of providing elegant, simple, and efficient solutions to problems arising in the analysis of systems over networks, a vibrant research area at the crossing of control theory and computer science.},

With a terminology of tasks and object-centered skills, industrial applications are analyzed in the logistic and assistive domains. The analysis shows that many tasks can actually be solved with a small library of predefined building blocks, called skills. In logistics domains, it can be exploited that the sequences of skills needed to solve specific tasks follow certain pat- terns, whereas in assistive tasks, the sequence vary a lot, and tasks must be taught to the robot by a user, based on Standard Operating Procedures or process knowledge. An overview is presented on how to implement a skill-based architecture, enabling reuse of skills for different industri- al applications, programmed by shop-floor workers. The terminology of tasks, skills, and motion primitives is intro- duced and designed to separate responsibilities of robot system developers, robot system integrators and shop floor users concerning programming of the robot system. The concept of testable pre- and postconditions assigned to the skills are proposed to help both in developing skills and asserting when a skill is applicable.},

Additionally, we consider improving a given suboptimal object arrangement through efficient rearrangement. Experiment results from over 2,700 simulated shelf trials and 54 physical trials using a Fetch robot equipped with a suction grasping tool and pushing blade suggest that an optimal arrangement can reduce the expected retrieval cost by 60&#x2013;80% in fully-observed configurations and reduce the expected search cost by 50&#x2013;70% while increasing the search success rate by up to 2x in partially-observed configurations. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;While there is a large literature on task and motion planning that studies how to rearrange objects from one arrangement to another, there is little research on what an ideal &#x201C;target&#x201D; arrangement should be.

We present the Optimal Shelf Arrangement (OSA) problem and algorithms to solve it. Although we assume access to a robot that can push and use a vacuum suction cup gripper, practitioners can adapt the OSA model to their own hardware and shelf constraints and objectives. Also, the algorithms for improving existing shelf arrangements can be applied to scenarios where the objects are already on the shelves rather than to be arranged from scratch.},

abstract = {The ability to modify existing plans to accommodate a variety of externally imposed constraints (such as changes in the problem specification, the expected world state, or the structure of the plan) is a valuable tool for improving efficiency of planning by avoiding repetition of planning effort. In this paper, we present a theory of incremental plan modification suitable for hierarchical nonlinear planning, and describe its implementation in a system called PRIAR. In this theory, the causal and teleological structure of the plans generated by a planner are represented in the form of an explanation of correctness called the "validation structure". Individual planning decisions are justified in terms of their relation to the validation structure. Plan modification is formalized as a process of removing inconsistencies in the validation structure of a plan when it is being reused in a new or changed planning situation. The repair of these inconsistencies involves removing unnecessary parts of the plan and adding new nonprimitive tasks to the plan to establish missing or failing validations. The result is a partially reduced plan with a consistent validation structure, which is then sent to the planner for complete reduction. We discuss this theory, present an empirical evaluation of the resulting plan modification system, and characterize the coverage, efficiency and limitations of the approach. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Robots are often required to generalize the skills learned from human demonstrations to fulfil new task requirements. However, skill generalization will be difficult to realize when facing with the following situations: the skill for a complex multistep task includes a number of features; some special constraints are imposed on the robots during the process of task reproduction; and a completely new situation quite different with the one in which demonstrations are given to the robot. This work proposes a new framework to facilitate robot skill generalization. The basic idea lies in that the learned skills are first segmented into a sequence of subskills automatically, then each individual subskill is encoded and regulated accordingly. Specifically, we adapt each set of the segmented movement trajectories individually instead of the whole movement profiles, thus, making it more convenient for the realization of skill generalization. In addition, human limb stiffness estimated from surface electromyographic signals is considered in the framework for the realization of human-to-robot variable impedance control skill transfer, as well as the generalization of both movement trajectories and stiffness profiles. Experimental study has been performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {I present several computational complexity results for propositional STRIPS planning, i.e., STRIPS planning restricted to ground formulas. Different planning problems can be defined by restricting the type of formulas, placing limits on the number of pre-and postconditions, by restricting negation in pre- and postconditions, and by requiring optimal plans. For these types of restrictions, I show when planning is tractable (polynomial) and intractable (NP-hard). In general, it is PSPACE-complete to determine if a given planning instance has any solutions. Extremely severe restrictions on both the operators and the formulas are required to guarantee polynomial time or even NP-completeness. For example, when only ground literals are permitted, determining plan existence is PSPACE-complete even if operators are limited to two preconditions and two postconditions. When definite Horn ground formulas are permitted, determining plan existence is PSPACE-complete even if operators are limited to zero preconditions and one postcondition. One of the interesting tractable problems is if each operator is restricted to positive preconditions and one postcondition (only ground literals). The blocks-world problem, slightly modified, is a subproblem of this restricted planning problem. These results in combination with previous analyses are not encouraging for domain-independent planning. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

In this competition, participants were given two types of datasets for each task: expert and mixed. Each expert dataset is collected by a high-skill policy, whereas the mixed dataset is collected using both expert and non-expert policies. We found that the vanilla behavioural cloning (BC) can learn a very proficient policy with minimal human intervention when trained on expert datasets. Notably, BC outperformed even the most advanced offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, when applied to mixed datasets, the performance of BC deteriorates; similarly, the performance of offline RL algorithms is also less than satisfactory. Upon examining the provided datasets, it was apparent that each mixed dataset contained a significant proportion of expert data, which should enable the training of a proficient BC agent. However, the expert data is not labelled in the datasets. As a result, we propose a classifier to identify the pattern of the expert behaviour within a mixed dataset and then utilize it to isolate the expert data. To further boost the BC performance, we take advantage of the geometric symmetry of the arena to augment the training dataset through mathematical transformations. Ultimately, our submission outperformed that of all other participants.},

For example, interest in planning demonstrated by the space research community has inspired work in observation scheduling, planetary rover exploration and spacecraft control domains. Other temporal and resource-intensive domains including logistics planning, plant control and manufacturing have also helped to focus the community on the modelling and reasoning issues that must be confronted to make planning technology meet the challenges of application. The International Planning Competitions have acted as an important motivating force behind the progress that has been made in planning since 1998. The third competition (held in 2002) set the planning community the challenge of handling time and numeric resources. This necessitated the development of a modelling language capable of expressing temporal and numeric properties of planning domains. In this paper we describe the language, PDDL2.1, that was used in the competition. We describe the syntax of the language, its formal semantics and the validation of concurrent plans. We observe that PDDL2.1 has considerable modelling power -exceeding the capabilities of current planning technology -and presents a number of important challenges to the research community. {\textcopyright} 2003 AI Access Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.

An olog is similar to a relational database schema; in fact an olog can serve as a data repository if desired. Unlike database schemas, which are generally difficult to create or modify, ologs are designed to be user-friendly enough that authoring or re-configuring an olog is a matter of course rather than a difficult chore. It is hoped that learning to author ologs is much simpler than learning a database definition language, despite their similarity. We describe ologs carefully and illustrate with many examples. As an application we show that any primitive recursive function can be described by an olog. We also show that ologs can be aligned or connected together into a larger network using functors. The various methods of information flow and institutions can then be used to in-tegrate local and global world-views. We finish by providing several different avenues for future research.},

To address this, in our prior work, we explained how knowledge from a successful task solution can be cached for later use, as an “abstract skill.” Such a skill is represented as a trace of states (“road map”) in an abstract space and can be matched with new tasks on-demand. This paper explains how one can use a library of abstract skills, derived from past planning experience, to reduce the computational cost of solving new task planning problems. As we explain, matching a skill to a task allows us to decompose it into independent sub-tasks, which can be quickly solved in parallel. This can be done automatically and dynamically during planning. We begin by formulating this problem of “planning with skills” as a constraint satisfaction problem. We then provide a hierarchical solution algorithm, which integrates with any standard task planner. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the computational benefits of the approach for reach-avoid tasks.},

abstract = {This chapter presents research works within the field of interoperability measurement. It outlines the set of interoperability measurement components, such as potentiality, compatibility and performance measurement. The chapter provides some running examples to better understand the metrics. Potentiality means that an enterprise owns intrinsic attributes related to the categories of interoperability (use of standard applications, enterprise models, database, etc.), allowing easy interoperability in the eventuality of a partnership. Interoperability degree gives information to partners about the presence (or absence) of incompatibilities disturbing the interoperability. This evaluation allows partners to avoid and/or correct deficiencies during the collaboration. The interoperability degree includes compatibility measurement and performance measurement. Compatibility measurement is done during the engineering stage, that is, when systems need to set up interoperability with a known partner. The performance measurement of interoperability allows enterprises to evaluate interoperability according to a set of predefined criteria.},

RoboGen leverages the latest advancements in foundation and generative models. Instead of directly using or adapting these models to produce policies or low-level actions, we advocate for a generative scheme, which uses these models to automatically generate diversified tasks, scenes, and training supervisions, thereby scaling up robotic skill learning with minimal human supervision. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a self-guided propose-generate-learn cycle: the agent first proposes interesting tasks and skills to develop, and then generates corresponding simulation environments by populating pertinent objects and assets with proper spatial configurations. Afterwards, the agent decomposes the proposed high-level task into sub-tasks, selects the optimal learning approach (reinforcement learning, motion planning, or trajectory optimization), generates required training supervision, and then learns policies to acquire the proposed skill. Our work attempts to extract the extensive and versatile knowledge embedded in large-scale models and transfer them to the field of robotics. Our fully generative pipeline can be queried repeatedly, producing an endless stream of skill demonstrations associated with diverse tasks and environments.},

@article{Schafer2021,
abstract = {Technology has sufficiently matured to enable, in principle, flexible and autonomous robotic assembly systems. However, in practice, it requires making all the relevant (implicit) knowledge that system engineers and workers have - about products to be assembled, tasks to be performed, as well as robots and their skills - available to the system explicitly. Only then can the planning and execution components of a robotic assembly pipeline communicate with each other in the same language and solve tasks autonomously without human intervention. This is why we have developed the Factory of the Future (FoF) ontology. At its core, this ontology models the tasks that are necessary to assemble a product and the robotic skills that can be employed to complete said tasks. The FoF ontology is based on existing standards. We started with theoretical considerations and iteratively adapted it based on practical experience gained from incorporating more and more components required for automated planning and assembly. Furthermore, we propose tools to extend the ontology for specific scenarios with knowledge about parts, robots, tools, and skills from various sources. The resulting scenario ontology serves us as world model for the robotic systems and other components of the assembly process. A central runtime interface to this world model provides fast and easy access to the knowledge during execution. In this work, we also show the integration of a graphical user front-end, an assembly planner, a workspace reconfigurator, and more components of the assembly pipeline that all communicate with the help of the FoF ontology. Overall, our integration of the FoF ontology with the other components of a robotic assembly pipeline shows that using an ontology is a practical method to establish a common language and understanding between the involved components.},

A functor F between schemas S and T, which can be generated from a visual mapping between graphs, induces three adjoint data migration functors, $\sigma$F : S-Inst → T-Inst, IIF : S-Inst → T-Inst, and $\Delta$F : T-Inst → S-Inst. We present an algebraic query language FQL based on these functors, prove that FQL is closed under composition, prove that FQL can be implemented with the select-project-product-union relational algebra (SPCU) extended with a key-generation operation, and prove that SPCU can be implemented with FQL.},

abstract = {Semantic interoperability is the ability of systems to exchange information with unambiguous meaning. This is an outstanding challenge in the development of Industry 4.0 due to the trend towards dynamic re-configurable production processes with increasingly complex automation systems and a diversity of standards, components, tools and services. The cost of making systems interoperable is a major limiting factor in the adoption of new technology and the envisioned development of production industry. Therefore, methods and concepts enabling efficient interoperation of heterogeneous systems are investigated to understand how the interoperability problem should be addressed. To support this development, we survey the literature on interoperability to identify automation approaches that address semantic interoperability, in particular in dynamic cyber-physical systems at large scale. We find that different aspects of the interoperability problem are investigated, some based on a conventional bottom-up standardization approach, while others consider a goal-driven computational approach; and that the different directions explored are related to open questions that motivates further research. We argue that a goaldriven machine learning approach to semantic interoperability can result in solutions that are applicable across standardization domains and thus is a promising direction of research in this era of the industrial internet of things.},

We consider axioms in the form of a logic program with recursively defined predicates and negationas-failure, as in PDDL 2.2. We show that problem formulations with axioms are not only more elegant, but can also be easier to solve, because specifying indirect action effects via axioms removes unnecessary choices from the search space of the planner. Despite their potential, however, axioms are not widely supported, particularly by cost-optimal planners. We draw on the connection between planning axioms and answer set programming to derive a consistency-based relaxation, from which we obtain axiom-aware versions of several admissible planning heuristics, such as hmax and pattern database heuristics.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce the olog, or ontology log, a category-theoretic model for knowledge representation (KR). Grounded in formal mathematics, ologs can be rigorously formulated and cross-compared in ways that other KR models (such as semantic networks) cannot. An olog is similar to a relational database schema; in fact an olog can serve as a data repository if desired. Unlike database schemas, which are generally difficult to create or modify, ologs are designed to be user-friendly enough that authoring or reconfiguring an olog is a matter of course rather than a difficult chore. It is hoped that learning to author ologs is much simpler than learning a database definition language, despite their similarity. We describe ologs carefully and illustrate with many examples. As an application we show that any primitive recursive function can be described by an olog. We also show that ologs can be aligned or connected together into a larger network using functors. The various methods of information flow and institutions can then be used to integrate local and global world-views. We finish by providing several different avenues for future research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Spivak, Kent.},

- unified - where there is a common format that serves as a meta-model that allows you to map to and from more specific models
- integrated - where there is a common format and all systems use it

For when systems are not designed to be interoperability, industry has developed a number of approaches
* data "bus" approach
* data dictionary approach
* data translator approach
* data server approach

Ideal interoperability of robot platforms does not just mean sharing functional and behavioral data between platforms, but also includes sharing data across platforms over time. With new upgrades, it is necessary that these architectures support data continuity.

There are five interoperability maturity levels outlined by the EU Framework 6. This includes:
(4) Harmonized data - all components can be tied to a documented conceptual model or abstraction
(3) Aligned dynamic data - data is defined using model-based engineering methods
(2) Aligned static data - common reference model for data schemas and attributes
(1) Documented data - shared protocol between systems accessible via interfaces

To address this issue, this paper describes an approach which allows human partners to teach a robot (i.e., a robotic arm) new high-level actions through natural language instructions. In particular, built upon the traditional planning framework, we propose a representation of high-level actions that only consists of the desired goal states rather than step-by-step operations (although these operations may be specified by the human in their instructions). Our empirical results have shown that, given this representation, the robot can reply on automated planning and immediately apply the newly learned action knowledge to perform actions under novel situations.},

abstract = {Integration of multiple, heterogeneous sensors is a challenging problem across a range of applications. Prominent among these are multi-target tracking, where one must combine observations from different sensor types in a meaningful and efficient way to track multiple targets. Because different sensors have differing error models, we seek a theoretically justified quantification of the agreement among ensembles of sensors, both overall for a sensor collection, and also at a fine-grained level specifying pairwise and multi-way interactions among sensors. We demonstrate that the theory of mathematical sheaves provides a unified answer to this need, supporting both quantitative and qualitative data. Furthermore, the theory provides algorithms to globalize data across the network of deployed sensors, and to diagnose issues when the data do not globalize cleanly. We demonstrate and illustrate the utility of sheaf-based tracking models based on experimental data of a wild population of black bears in Asheville, North Carolina. A measurement model involving four sensors deployed among the bears and the team of scientists charged with tracking their location is deployed. This provides a sheaf-based integration model which is small enough to fully interpret, but of sufficient complexity to demonstrate the sheaf's ability to recover a holistic picture of the locations and behaviors of both individual bears and the bear-human tracking system. A statistical approach was developed in parallel for comparison, a dynamic linear model which was estimated using a Kalman filter. This approach also recovered bear and human locations and sensor accuracies. When the observations are normalized into a common coordinate system, the structure of the dynamic linear observation model recapitulates the structure of the sheaf model, demonstrating the canonicity of the sheaf-based approach. However, when the observations are not so normalized, the sheaf model still remains valid.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Middlewares are fundamental tools for progress in research and applications in robotics. They enable the integration of multiple heterogeneous sensing and actuation devices, as well as providing general purpose modules for key robotics functions (kinematics, navigation, and planning). However, no existing middleware yet provides a complete set of functionalities for all robotics applications, and many robots may need to rely on more than one framework. This paper focuses on the interoperability between two of the most prevalent middleware in robotics: YARP and ROS. Interoperability between middlewares should ideally allow users to execute existing software without the necessity of (i) changing the existing code and (ii) writing hand-coded "bridges" for each use case. We propose a framework enabling the communication between existing YARP modules and ROS nodes for robotics applications in an automated way. Our approach generates the "bridging gap" code from a configuration file, connecting YARP ports and ROS topics through code-generated YARP bottles. We support YARP/ROS and ROS/YARP sender/receiver configurations, which are demonstrated in a humanoid on wheels robot that uses YARP for upper body motor control and visual perception, and ROS for mobile base control and navigation algorithms.},

abstract = {Websites that provide content creation and sharing features have become quite popular recently. These sites allow users to categorize and browse content using 'tags' or free-text keyword topics. Since users contribute and tag social media content across a variety of social web platforms, creating new knowledge from distributed tag data has become a matter of performing various tasks, including publishing, aggregating, integrating, and republishing tag data. However, there are a number of issues in relation to data sharing and interoperability when processing tag data across heterogeneous tagging platforms. In this paper we introduce a semantic tag model that aims to explicitly offer the necessary structure, semantics and relationships between tags. This approach provides an improved opportunity for representing tag data in the form of reusable constructs at a semantic level. We also demonstrate a prototype that consumes and makes use of shared tag metadata across heterogeneous sources.},

The conditions under which productions can be applied are called application conditions. Although the generative power of most of the known general graph-grammar approaches is sufficient to generate any recursively enumerable set of graphs, it is often convenient to have specific application conditions for each production. Such application conditions, on the one hand, include context conditions like the existence or non-existence of nodes, edges, or certain subgraphs in the given graph as well as embedding restrictions concerning the morphisms from the left-hand side of the production to the given graph. In this paper, the concept of application conditions introduced by Ehrig and Habel is restricted to contextual conditions, especially negative ones. In addition to the general concept, we state local confluence and the Parallelism Theorem for derivations with application conditions. Finally we study context-free graph grammars with application conditions with respect to their generative power.},

Existing solutions however require an extended definition of the mappings that, e.g., also describes how generated elements need to be connected. In this paper, we propose a generic transformation algorithm that is able to execute mappings that do not specify such extended information by analyzing the structure of the target meta-model. This limits the effort necessary for the definition of mappings and ensures a valid target model already at early stages of development. After analyzing the tasks that model transformations needs to perform, we present our approach towards generic transformation rules for models that are based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework and illustrate a concrete implementation by means of an integration into our own model transformation framework.},

abstract = {Despite progress in perceptual tasks such as image classification, computers still perform poorly on cognitive tasks such as image description and question answering. Cognition is core to tasks that involve not just recognizing, but reasoning about our visual world. However, models used to tackle the rich content in images for cognitive tasks are still being trained using the same datasets designed for perceptual tasks. To achieve success at cognitive tasks, models need to understand the interactions and relationships between objects in an image. When asked “What vehicle is the person riding?”, computers will need to identify the objects in an image as well as the relationships riding(man, carriage) and pulling(horse, carriage) to answer correctly that “the person is riding a horse-drawn carriage.” In this paper, we present the Visual Genome dataset to enable the modeling of such relationships. We collect dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships within each image to learn these models. Specifically, our dataset contains over 108K images where each image has an average of 35 objects, 26 attributes, and 21 pairwise relationships between objects. We canonicalize the objects, attributes, relationships, and noun phrases in region descriptions and questions answer pairs to WordNet synsets. Together, these annotations represent the densest and largest dataset of image descriptions, objects, attributes, relationships, and question answer pairs.},

However, policies trained in simulations usually have unsatisfactory performance in the real world because simulators inevitably model reality imperfectly. Inspired by biological transfer learning processes in the brains of humans and other animals, sim-to-real transfer reinforcement learning has been proposed and has become a focus of researchers applying reinforcement learning to robotics. Here, we describe state-of-the-art sim-to-real transfer reinforcement learning methods, which are inspired by insights into transfer learning in nature, such as extracting features in common between tasks, enriching training experience, multitask learning, continual learning and fast learning. Our objective is to present a comprehensive survey of the most recent advances in sim-to-real transfer reinforcement learning.

  abstract        = {Real-world planning problems often involve hundreds or even thousands of objects, straining the limits of modern planners. In this work, we address this challenge by learning to predict a small set of objects that, taken together, would be sufficient for finding a plan. We propose a graph neural network architecture for predicting object importance in a single inference pass, thus incurring little overhead while greatly reducing the number of objects that must be considered by the planner. Our approach treats the planner and transition model as black boxes, and can be used with any off-the-shelf planner. Empirically, across classical planning, probabilistic planning, and robotic task and motion planning, we find that our method results in planning that is significantly faster than several baselines, including other partial grounding strategies and lifted planners. We conclude that learning to predict a sufficient set of objects for a planning problem is a simple, powerful, and general mechanism for planning in large instances.

abstract = {This paper introduces a Monte-Carlo algorithm for online planning in large POMDPs. The algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo update of the agent's belief state with a Monte-Carlo tree search from the current belief state. The new algorithm, POMCP, has two important properties. First, Monte-Carlo sampling is used to break the curse of dimensionality both during belief state updates and during planning. Second, only a black box simulator of the POMDP is required, rather than explicit probability distributions. These properties enable POMCP to plan effectively in significantly larger POMDPs than has previously been possible. We demonstrate its effectiveness in three large POMDPs. We scale up a well-known benchmark problem, rocksample, by several orders of magnitude. We also introduce two challenging new POMDPs: 10 × 10 battleship and partially observable PacMan, with approximately 10 18 and 10 56 states respectively. Our Monte-Carlo planning algorithm achieved a high level of performance with no prior knowledge, and was also able to exploit simple domain knowledge to achieve better results with less search. POMCP is the first general purpose planner to achieve high performance in such large and unfactored POMDPs.},

abstract = {In robotic domains, learning and planning are complicated by continuous state spaces, continuous action spaces, and long task horizons. In this work, we address these challenges with Neuro-Symbolic Relational Transition Models (NSRTs), a novel class of models that are data-efficient to learn, compatible with powerful robotic planning methods, and generalizable over objects. NSRTs have both symbolic and neural components, enabling a bilevel planning scheme where symbolic AI planning in an outer loop guides continuous planning with neural models in an inner loop. Experiments in four robotic planning domains show that NSRTs can be learned very data-efficiently, and then used for fast planning in new tasks that require up to 60 actions and involve many more objects than were seen during training.},

abstract = {This thesis develops the theory of sheaves and cosheaves with an eye towards applications in science and engineering. To provide a theory that is computable, we focus on a combinatorial version of sheaves and cosheaves called cellular sheaves and cosheaves, which are finite families of vector spaces and maps parametrized by a cell complex. We develop cellular (co)sheaves as a new tool for topological data analysis, network coding and sensor networks. A foundation for multi-dimensional level-set persistent homology is laid via constructible cosheaves, which are equivalent to representations of MacPherson's entrance path category. By proving a van Kampen theorem, we give a direct proof of this equivalence. A cosheaf version of the i'th derived pushforward of the constant sheaf along a definable map is constructed directly as a representation of this category. We go on to clarify the relationship of cellular sheaves to cosheaves by providing a formula that defines a derived equivalence, which in turn recovers Verdier duality. Compactly-supported sheaf cohomology is expressed as the coend with the image of the constant sheaf through this equivalence. The equivalence is further used to establish relations between sheaf cohomology and a herein newly introduced theory of cellular sheaf homology. Inspired to provide fast algorithms for persistence, we prove that the derived category of cellular sheaves over a 1D cell complex is equivalent to a category of graded sheaves. Finally, we introduce the interleaving distance as an extended pseudo-metric on the category of sheaves. We prove that global sections partition the space of sheaves into connected components. We conclude with an investigation into the geometry of the space of constructible sheaves over the real line, which we relate to the bottleneck distance in persistence.},

abstract = {PDDL+ is an extension of PDDL2.1 which incorporates fully-featured autonomous processes and allows for better modelling of mixed discrete-continuous domains. Unlike PDDL2.1, PDDL+ lacks a logical semantics, relying instead on state-transitional semantics enriched with hybrid automata semantics for the continuous states. This complex semantics makes analysis and comparisons to other action formalisms difficult. In this paper, we propose a natural extension of Reiter's situation calculus theories inspired by hybrid automata. The kinship between PDDL+ and hybrid automata allows us to develop a direct mapping between PDDL+ and situation calculus, thereby supplying PDDL+ with a logical semantics and the situation calculus with a modern way of representing autonomous processes. We outline the potential benefits of the mapping by suggesting a new approach to effective planning in PDDL+.},

Most robotic planning algorithms are concerned with producing plans that minimize execution cost, or generalizations of such costs. Motivated by circumstances with severe computational resource limits (e.g., memory or communication constrained settings), we instead address the problem of producing concise plans. In this work, conciseness is a measure of plan size that reflects the complexity of representing the plan explicitly. We seek a plan with minimal representational size, subject to correctness and completeness. We introduce a planning algorithm that generates concise plans for planning problems that may involve both non-determinism and partial observability, and also show that finding the most concise plan is an NP-hard problem, excusing the possible sub-optimality of our algorithm's output. We describe an implementation of the algorithm, along with empirical results on the run time and solution quality for both manipulation and navigation problem domains. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The new technical idea for the APRS project is to develop the measurement science in the form of an integrated agility framework enabling manufacturers to assess and assure the agility performance of their robot systems. This framework includes robot agility performance metrics, information models, test methods, and protocols. This paper presents models for the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), used within the APRS project. PDDL is an attempt to standardize Artificial Intelligence planning languages. The described models have been fully defi ned in the XML Schema Definition Language (XSDL) and in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) for kit building applications. Kit building or kitting is a process that brings parts that will be used in assembly operations together in a kit and then moves the kit to the area where the parts are used in the final assembly. Furthermore, the paper discusses a tool that is capable of automatically and dynamically generating PDDL files from the models in order to generate a plan or to replan from scratch. Finally, the ability of the tool to update a PDDL problem file from a relational database for replanning to recover from failures is presented.},

The net effect is that programs may be written at a much higher level of abstraction than is usually possible.

Current methods for learning to identify symbolic states in visual data require large amounts of labeled training data, but manually annotating such datasets is prohibitively expensive due to the combinatorial number of predicates in images. We propose a novel method for automatically labeling symbolic states in large-scale video activity datasets by exploiting known pre- and post-conditions of actions. This automatic labeling scheme only requires weak supervision in the form of an action label that describes which action is demonstrated in each video. We use our framework to train predicate classifiers to identify symbolic relationships between objects when prompted with object bounding boxes, and demonstrate that such predicate classifiers can match the performance of those trained with full supervision at a fraction of the labeling cost. We also apply our framework to an existing large-scale human activity dataset, and demonstrate the ability of these predicate classifiers trained on human data to enable closed-loop task planning in the real world.},

Further, assuming "conservative" plan modification, plan reuse can actually be strictly more difficult than plan generation. While these results do not imply that there won't be an efficiency gain in some situations, retrieval of a good plan may present a serious bottleneck for plan reuse systems, as we will show. Finally, we present the results of an empirical study of two different plan reuse systems, pointing out possible pitfalls one should be aware of when attempting to employ reuse methods. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

One of the main findings in this paper is that the required equivalence relation among spans is compatible with, but coarser than, the one expected.

Population characteristics from these studies are compared with results from a 1977-79 study in sandstone escarpment country 40 km to the south-east and from studies in a range of habitats on the Mitchell Plateau in the Kimberley. Populations in rocky country are most dense with animals often surviving two or three years. In contrast, populations in savanna are more sparse, with males and females rarely surviving beyond one mating season. While all populations seem to undergo an annual period of stress, it is the savanna populations that seem most vulnerable. An analysis of the distribution of northern quolls shows a 75% recent range reduction, from being widespread over much of northern Australia to six smaller rocky regions.

abstract = {Robots have become significantly more powerful and intelligent over the last decade, and are moving in to more service oriented roles. As a result robots will more often be used by people with minimal technical skills and so there is a need for easier to use and more flexible programming systems. This paper reviews the current state of the art in robot programming systems. A distinction is made between manual and automatic programming systems. Manual systems require the user/programmer to create the robot program directly, by hand, while automatic systems generate a robot program as a result of interaction between the robot and the human; there are a variety of methods including learning, programming by demonstration and instructive systems.},
annote = {Manual vs. Automatic

-- Manual --
* User creates robot program directly
a. Manual Programming
1. Controller specific languages (KUKA KRL, ABB Rapids)
* lacks universal standards
* solution: write abstracted languages that remove controller specific programming, but become application specific
2. Generic procedural languages
* uses multi-purpose language
* still robot specific even with decent abstractions (often object oriented)
3. Behavior-based languages (FRP)
* describes how to react to conditions, not a procedure 
b. Graphical Programming (LEGO mindsotrm)
* require manual input to describe program flow
* easy to use, but not as flexible as text-based languages
1. Graph systems
2. Flowchart systems
3. Diagrammatic systems

-- Automatic --
* Code is generated from person interacting with it
a . learning systems
* examples and self-exploration of robot to learn
b. program by demonstration
1. Teach pendant
* record positions or move robot physically
* research questions: (1) product better robot program by combining multiple demonstrations by breaking down information into segments (2) improve demonstration options using multimodal communication
2. Gesture/voice/vision
c. instructive systems
* give instructions to exeecute in real-time



--- In Pointillist ---
This provides an outline of the currently available programming methods:
A. Manual
1. Manual Programming
a. Controller-specific languages (KUKA KRL, ABB Rapids)
b. Generic procedural languages (Python, C++)
c. Behavior-based programming (FRP, Frob, Yampa)
2. Graphical Programming
a. Graph systems
b. Flowchart systems
c. Diagrammatic systems
B. Automatic
1. Learning Systems
2. Program by demonstration
a. Teach pendant
b. Gesture/voice/vision
3. Instructive systems

The main challenges with manual programming are that the abstractions cause them to be controller or application specific. Translation frameworks have been introduced by Freud et. al.
The main challenges with automatic programming is that the programs are difficult to combine or re-used across demonstrations. Research is being done to fragment demonstrations into tasks that can be composed.},

In this work, we investigate the applicability of a smaller class of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-2, in robotic task planning by learning to decompose tasks into subgoal specifications for a planner to execute sequentially. Our method grounds the input of the LLM on the domain that is represented as a scene graph, enabling it to translate human requests into executable robot plans, thereby learning to reason over long-horizon tasks, as encountered in the ALFRED benchmark. We compare our approach with classical planning and baseline methods to examine the applicability and generalizability of LLM-based planners. Our findings suggest that the knowledge stored in an LLM can be effectively grounded to perform long-horizon task planning, demonstrating the promising potential for the future application of neuro-symbolic planning methods in robotics.},

They will assist us in our daily routines and perform dangerous, dirty, and dull tasks. However, enabling robotic systems to perform autonomously in complex, real-world scenarios over extended time periods (i.e., weeks, months, or years) poses many challenges. Some of these have been investigated by subdisciplines of Artificial Intelligence (AI) including navigation and mapping, perception, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, interaction, and learning. The different subdisciplines have developed techniques that, when re-integrated within an autonomous system, can enable robots to operate effectively in complex, long-term scenarios. In this letter, we survey and discuss AI techniques as 'enablers' for long-term robot autonomy, current progress in integrating these techniques within long-running robotic systems, and the future challenges and opportunities for AI in long-term autonomy.},

abstract = {Assembly tasks are challenging for robot manipulation because the robot must reason over the composed effects of actions and execute multi-objective behaviors. Robots typically use predefined priorities provided by users to determine how to compose controller behaviors, but we want the robot to autonomously select these compositions based on their composed effects within the task. We present Composable Causality in Semantic Robot Programming to allow robots to reason over the composed effects of controllers when executing multi-objective actions and autonomously compose controllers without predefined priorities. Our proposed causal control basis combines controller behaviors with causal information about how the behaviors can be used to execute high-level symbolic actions. The robot uses the causal control basis to predict the transition probability of achieving the composed effects of a multi-objective action. The composed causality estimates are used to select which action to execute within the context of a furniture assembly task. We evaluate the robot's transition probability estimates in different furniture assembly trials in simulation on the Baxter robot. The robot's ability to assemble furniture using different multi-objective connection actions demonstrates the usefulness of the composed causality estimates from our causal control basis.},

abstract = {Task planning for mobile robots usually relies solely on spatial information and on shallow domain knowledge, such as labels attached to objects and places. Although spatial information is necessary for performing basic robot operations (navigation and localization), the use of deeper domain knowledge is pivotal to endow a robot with higher degrees of autonomy and intelligence. In this paper, we focus on semantic knowledge, and show how this type of knowledge can be profitably used for robot task planning. We start by defining a specific type of semantic maps, which integrates hierarchical spatial information and semantic knowledge. We then proceed to describe how these semantic maps can improve task planning in two ways: extending the capabilities of the planner by reasoning about semantic information, and improving the planning efficiency in large domains. We show several experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions in a domain involving robot navigation in a domestic environment. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We will then have a look at the latest developments of domestic floor cleaning robots, robotic pool cleaners, and window cleaning robots. The survey of domestic cleaning robotics concludes with an outlook to new technologies that might help to solve some of the problems discussed at the beginning.

The Section Smart appliances briefly surveys the latest developments in ironing robotics, intelligent refrigerators, and digital wardrobes. The Section Smart homes looks into a selection of ongoing and completed research projects in the field of smart environments and smart homes.

A pattern database (PDB) for a planning task is a heuristic function in the form of a lookup table that contains optimal solution costs of a simplified version of the task. In this planner we use a method that sequentially creates multiple PDBs which are later combined into a single heuristic function. At a given iteration, our method uses estimates of the A * running time to create a PDB that complements the strengths of the PDBs created in previous iterations. We used symbolic PDBs because the current implementation supports conditional effects , a requirement in the IPC18. Additionally, in our benchmark tests, this was the best option even without conditional effects.},

The language is designed to allow as much flexibility as necessary on the lowest level of abstraction and is kept as simple as possible with the more abstract layers. A Statechart like model is used to describe the different levels of detail. For this we apply the UML/P and the language workbench MontiCore. To this end we are able to generate code while hiding controller specific implementation details.

abstract = {Robots deployed in many real-world settings need to be able to acquire new skills and solve new tasks over time. Prior works on planning with skills often make assumptions on the structure of skills and tasks, such as subgoal skills, shared skill implementations, or task-specific plan skeletons, which limit adaptation to new skills and tasks. By contrast, we propose doing task planning by jointly searching in the space of parameterized skills using high-level skill effect models learned in simulation. We use an iterative training procedure to efficiently generate relevant data to train such models. Our approach allows flexible skill parameterizations and task specifications to facilitate lifelong learning in general-purpose domains. Experiments demonstrate the ability of our planner to integrate new skills in a lifelong manner, finding new task strategies with lower costs in both train and test tasks. We additionally show that our method can transfer to the real world without further fine-tuning.},

Unlike PDDL2.1, PDDL+ lacks a logical semantics, relying instead on state-transitional semantics enriched with hybrid automata semantics for the continuous states. This complex semantics makes analysis and comparisons to other action formalisms difficult. In this paper, we propose a natural extension of Reiter's situation calculus theories inspired by hybrid automata. The kinship between PDDL+ and hybrid automata allows us to develop a direct mapping between PDDL+ and situation calculus, thereby supplying PDDL+ with a logical semantics and the situation calculus with a modern way of representing autonomous processes. We outline the potential benefits of the mapping by suggesting a new approach to effective planning in PDDL+.},

abstract = {Automated Driving (AD) datasets, when used in combination with deep learning techniques, have enabled significant progress on difficult AD tasks such as perception, trajectory prediction and motion planning. These datasets represent the content of driving scenes as captured by various sensors, including cameras, RADAR, and LiDAR, along with 2D/3D annotations of traffic participants. Such datasets, however, often fail to capture and to represent the spatial, temporal, functional, and semantic relations between entities in a scene. This lack of knowledge leads to a shallow understanding of the true complexity and dynamics inherent in a driving scene. In this paper, we argue that a knowledge graph based representation of driving scenes, that provides a richer structure and semantics, will lead to further improvements in automated driving. Towards this goal, we developed a layered architecture and ontologies for specific automated driving datasets and a fundamental ontology of shared concepts. We also built knowledge graphs (KG) for three different AD datasets. We perform an analysis w.r.t. information contained in the AD KGs and outline how the additional semantic information contained in the KGs could improve the performance of different AD tasks. Moreover, example queries are provided to retrieve relevant information that can be exploited for augmenting the AD pipelines.

abstract = {A significant obstacle for service robots is the execution of complex tasks in real environments. For example, it is not easy for service robots to find objects that are partially observable and are located at a place which is not identical but near the place where the robots saw them previously. To overcome the challenge effectively, robot knowledge represented as a semantic network can be extremely useful. This paper presents an ontology-based unified robot knowledge framework that integrates low-level data with high-level knowledge for robot intelligence. This framework consists of two sections: knowledge description and knowledge association. Knowledge description includes comprehensively integrated robot knowledge derived from low-level knowledge regarding perceptual features, part objects, metric maps, and primitive behaviors, as well as high-level knowledge about perceptual concepts, objects, semantic maps, tasks, and contexts. Knowledge association uses logical inference with both unidirectional and bidirectional rules. This characteristic enables reasoning to be performed even when only a partial information is available. The experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of using the proposed knowledge framework are also presented. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) reasoning technology involving, e.g., inference, planning, and learning, has a track record with a healthy number of successful applications. So, can it be used as a toolbox of methods for autonomous mobile robots? Not necessarily, as reasoning on a mobile robot about its dynamic, partially known environment may differ substantially from that in knowledge-based pure software systems, where most of the named successes have been registered. This Chapter sketches the main robotics-relevant topics of symbol-based AI reasoning. Basic methods of knowledge representation and inference are described in general, covering both logic- and probability-based approaches. Then, some robotics-related particularities are addressed specially: issues in logic-based high-level robot control, fuzzy logics, and reasoning under time constraints. Two generic applications of reasoning are then described in some detail: action planning and learning. General reasoning is currently not a standard feature onboard autonomous mobile robots. Beyond sketching the state of the art in robotics-related AI reasoning, this Chapter points to the involved research problems that remain to be solved towards that end. The Chapter first reviews knowledge representation and deduction in general (Sect. 9.1), and then goes into some detail regarding reasoning issues that are considered particularly relevant for applications in robots (Sect. 9.2). Having presented reasoning methods, we then enter the field of generic reasoning applications, namely, action planning (Sect. 9.3) and machine learning (Sect. 9.4). Section 9.5 concludes.},

abstract = {Case-based planning can take advantage of former problem-solving experiences by storing in a plan library previously generated plans that can be reused to solve similar planning problems in the future. Although comparative worst-case complexity analyses of plan generation and reuse techniques reveal that it is not possible to achieve provable efficiency gain of reuse over generation, we show that the case-based planning approach can be an effective alternative to plan generation when similar reuse candidates can be chosen. In this paper we describe an innovative case-based planning system, called OAKplan, which can efficiently retrieve planning cases from plan libraries containing more than ten thousand cases, choose heuristically a suitable candidate and adapt it to provide a good quality solution plan which is similar to the one retrieved from the case library. Given a planning problem we encode it as a compact graph structure, that we call Planning Encoding Graph, which gives us a detailed description of the topology of the planning problem. By using this graph representation, we examine an approximate retrieval procedure based on kernel functions that effectively match planning instances, achieving extremely good performance in standard benchmark domains. The experimental results point out the effect of the case base size and the importance of accurate matching functions for global system performance. Overall, we show that OAKplan is competitive with state-of-the-art plan generation systems in terms of number of problems solved, CPU time, plan difference values and plan quality when cases similar to the current planning problem are available in the plan library. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate the reversibility of STRIPS actions, that is, when the effects of an action can be reverted by applying other actions, in order to return to the original state. We propose a broad notion of reversibility that generalizes previously defined versions and investigate interesting properties and relevant restrictions. In particular, we propose the concept of uniform reversibility that guarantees that an action can be reverted independently of the state in which the action was applied, using a socalled reverse plan. In addition, we perform an in-depth investigation of the computational complexity of deciding action reversibility. We show that reversibility checking with polynomial-length reverse plans is harder than polynomiallength planning and that, in case of unrestricted plan length, the PSPACE-hardness of planning is inherited. In order to deal with the high complexity of solving these tasks, we then propose several incomplete algorithms that may be used to compute reverse plans for a relevant subset of states.},

abstract={ This paper combines the vocabulary of semiotics and category theory to provide a formal analysis of visualization. It shows how familiar processes of visualization fit the semiotic frameworks of both Saussure and Peirce, and extends these structures using the tools of category theory to provide a general framework for understanding visualization in practice, including: Relationships between systems, data collected from those systems, renderings of those data in the form of representations, the reading of those representations to create visualizations, and the use of those visualizations to create knowledge and understanding of the system under inspection. The resulting framework is validated by demonstrating how familiar information visualization concepts (such as literalness, sensitivity, redundancy, ambiguity, generalizability, and chart junk) arise naturally from it and can be defined formally and precisely. This paper generalizes previous work on the formal characterization of visualization by, inter alia, Ziemkiewicz and Kosara and allows us to formally distinguish properties of the visualization process that previous work does not. },

abstract = {Higher-level fusion (e.g., Level 2 that deals with derivation of relations among objects) often involves symbolic processing of information obtained from lower levels (e.g., Level 1, which deals with object detection, identification and tracking) which is based upon quantitative algorithms. The quantitative algorithms pass only some information to higher levels; some of the information is abstracted away in this process. However, this information might be needed by some of the rules at a higher level. Should in such a case the whole system be re-coded? In this paper we present an attempt to overcome the need for re-coding the Level 1 software. Instead, we propose to replace the activity of manually developing a fusion algorithm with an automated synthesis of the specification of the algorithm followed by automatic code generation. While solving such a problem in its entirety is a rather distant goal, in this paper we propose a solution to a more modest sub-problem. Rather than attempting to solve arbitrary information fusion problems, we assume that there exists a library of templates that specify information fusion objectives. The templates are formal specifications represented in a formal language. Since they are declarative, a variety of algorithms can satisfy their requirements. This paper presents an example of using a formal, category theory-based approach to the problem of synthesizing algorithms that satisfy templates for information fusion.},

abstract = {There is increasing awareness in the planning community that depending on complete models impedes the applicability of planning technology in many real world domains where the burden of specifying complete domain models is too high. In this paper, we consider a novel solution for this challenge that combines generative planning on incomplete domain models with a library of plan cases that are known to be correct. While this was arguably the original motivation for case-based planning, most existing case-based planners assume (and depend on) from-scratch planners that work on complete domain models. In contrast, our approach views the plan generated with respect to the incomplete model as a "skeletal plan" and augments it with directed mining of plan fragments from library cases. We will present the details of our approach and present an empirical evaluation of our method in comparison to a state-of-the-art case-based planner that depends on complete domain models.

To perform this task, the robot learns a pixel-level inverse dynamics model of rope manipulation directly from images in a self-supervised manner, using about 60K interactions with the rope collected autonomously by the robot. The human demonstration provides a high-level plan of what to do and the low-level inverse model is used to execute the plan. We show that by combining the high and low-level plans, the robot can successfully manipulate a rope into a variety of target shapes using only a sequence of human-provided images for direction.},

In such environments, a human and robot should collaborate with each other. Therefore, the robot must act in accordance with the human and avoid useless actions duplicated with those of humans. However, any action undertaken by a human has uncertainty, and thus, predicting them correctly is challenging. This study proposed probabilistic task and motion planning considering both deterministic and probabilistic environment changes caused by robot and human actions temporarily and spatially, respectively. First, the environmental changes were modeled, where the robot is capable of recognizing the possibility of environmental changes. Second, in task planning, the probabilities of each environmental change owing to human actions was minimized. Finally, in motion planning, a movement path connecting each task in a planned order was planned, thereby enabling the robot to perform actions not duplicated with those by a human. Furthermore, the plans generated were compared without considering possibility of human actions and the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified. Consequently, the proposed method was confirmed to reduce the time required for finishing the tasks.},

A popular approach to do so is called model reconciliation, where the planning agent tries to reconcile the differences between its model and the model of the user such that its plan is also feasible and optimal to the user. This problem can be viewed as an optimization problem, where the goal is to find a subsetminimal explanation that one can use to modify the model of the user such that the plan of the agent is also feasible and optimal to the user. This paper presents an algorithm for solving such problems using answer set programming.},

abstract = {We examine a novel setting in which two parties have partial knowledge of the elements that make up a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and must cooperate to compute and execute an optimal policy for the problem constructed from those elements. This situation arises when one party wants to give a robot some task, but does not wish to divulge those details to a second party-while the second party possesses sensitive data about the robot's dynamics (information needed for planning). Both parties want the robot to perform the task successfully, but neither is willing to disclose any more information than is absolutely necessary. We utilize techniques from secure multi-party computation, combining primitives and algorithms to construct protocols that can compute an optimal policy while ensuring that the policy remains opaque by being split across both parties. To execute a split policy, we also give a protocol that enables the robot to determine what actions to trigger, while the second party guards against attempts to probe for information inconsistent with the policy's prescribed execution. In order to improve scalability, we find that basis functions and constraint sampling methods are useful in forming effective approximate MDPs. We report simulation results examining performance and precision, and assess the scaling properties of our Python implementation. We also describe a hardware proof-of-feasibility implementation using inexpensive physical robots, which, being a small-scale instance, can be solved directly.},

Aspiring to have one unified structure that hosts diverse types of semantics, we follow the Scene Graph paradigm in 3D, generating a 3D Scene Graph. Given a 3D mesh and registered panoramic images, we construct a graph that spans the entire building and includes semantics on objects (e.g., class, material, shape and other attributes), rooms (e.g., function, illumination type, etc.) and cameras (e.g., location, etc.), as well as the relationships among these entities. However, this process is prohibitively labor heavy if done manually. To alleviate this we devise a semi-automatic framework that employs existing detection methods and enhances them using two main constraints: I. framing of query images sampled on panoramas to maximize the performance of 2D detectors, and II. multi-view consistency enforcement across 2D detections that originate in different camera locations.},

More specifically, we provide mutually compatible tools for hierarchical, sequential, and independent parallel composition. In our framework, hierarchies of hybrid systems correspond to template-anchor pairs, which we model as spans of subdividing and embedding semiconjugacies. Hierarchical composition of template-anchor pairs corresponds to the composition of spans via fiber product. To model sequential composition, we introduce “directed hybrid systems,” each of which flows from an initial subsystem to a final subsystem in a Conley-theoretic sense. Sequential composition of directed systems is given by a pushout of graph embeddings, rewriting the continuous dynamics of the overlapping subsystem to prioritize the second directed system. Independent parallel composition corresponds to a categorical product with respect to semiconjugacy. To formalize the compatibility of these three types of composition, we construct a vertically cartesian double category of hybrid systems where the vertical morphisms are semiconjugacies, and the horizontal morphisms are directed hybrid systems.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to propose a translation library capable of generating robots proprietary code after their offline programming has been performed in a software application, named AdaptPack Studio, running over a robot simulation and offline programming software package. Design/methodology/approach: The translation library, named AdaptPack Studio Translator, is capable to generate proprietary code for the Asea Brown Boveri, FANUC, Keller und Knappich Augsburg and Yaskawa Motoman robot brands, after their offline programming has been performed in the AdaptPack Studio application. Findings: Simulation and real tests were performed showing an improvement in the creation, operation, modularity and flexibility of new robotic palletizing systems. In particular, it was verified that the time needed to perform these tasks significantly decreased. Practical implications: The design and setup of robotics palletizing systems are facilitated by an intuitive offline programming system and by a simple export command to the real robot, independent of its brand. In this way, industrial solutions can be developed faster, in this way, making companies more competitive. Originality/value: The effort to build a robotic palletizing system is reduced by an intuitive offline programming system (AdaptPack Studio) and the capability to export command to the real robot using the AdaptPack Studio Translator. As a result, companies have an increase in competitiveness with a fast design framework. Furthermore, and to the best of the author's knowledge, there is also no scientific publication formalizing and describing how to build the translators for industrial robot simulation and offline programming software packages, being this a pioneer publication in this area.},
annote = {To its knowledge, there is no work done to formalize translators for industrial robot simulation and offline programming software.

(Pan et al.,2010) - Offline programming involves:
1. 3d modeling of robot workcell
2. trajectory and process planning
3. simulation and calibration
4. post-processing (translating from program to controller-specific language)

Robot programming languages for interoperability and standardization:
* Industrial Robot Language (not used by people)
* Bottazzi 2005 (developing generic language and generating native code but only basic commands are geenrated)
* Bruccoleri 2007 (developing generic language and generating native code but only basic commands are translated)
* Freund 2001 (translates controller-specific languages to simulation language to ease simulation)

Usual approach to expedite development is to use custom simulation software per robot:
* ABB RobotStudio
* FANUC RoboGuide
* Delmia (2018)
* RobotExpert (2018)
* RoboDK (2018)
* Visual components (2018)

This paper used Visual Components as its chosen simulation software. But it did not have the ability translate from VC to proprietary robot programming languages, so a translator was developed AdaptPack Studio Translator.

The AdaptPack Studio Translator supports the generation of code to: ABB, FANUC, KUKA, Yaskawa

A comparative evaluation of each those languages is in Souza 2019


User needs to only select a button embedded in VC to run translation and can select the target language. The AdaptPack Translator consists of three components: (1) core, (2) parser, (3) translator.

**The AdaptPack Translator requires a common intermediate model, namely VC, prior to being able to generate robot code in a target platform language.**

[Core]
Core is the UI component that triggers the translation

[Parser]
The parser component takes the data and instructions via the Robot Sequence Language API and reformats it into a custom data structure that resembles a stack that contains every instruction and its parameter based on the 3D model.

The data types supported by the parser are integer, double, string, and Boolean.

[Translator]
There is a translator for every language. The translator steps stakes the program data stack and converts the data to a Target, Base Frame, and Tool Frame. Handles headers and file writing first. For every instruction in the stack, it "converts" it to the target syntax. Once it is finished, it writes out the file.
Program semantics are included in the translator implementation per language.

**But how does it manage the mapping between syntaxes???**

[Evaluation]
The translator was verifed by running programs in real and simulated environments to check functionality and syntax of generated code.},

Many disciplines such as design, planning, scheduling, and manufacturing execution need to be carefully engineered and coordinated to create successful product assembly plans. Recent research in the field of design for assembly has proposed new methodologies to design product structures in such a way that their assembly is easier. However, present assembly planning approaches lack the engineering tool support to capture all the constraints associated to assembly planning in a unified manner. This paper proposes CompositionalPlanning, a string diagram based framework for assembly planning. In the proposed framework, string diagrams and their compositional properties serve as the foundation for an engineering tool where CAD designs interact with planning and scheduling algorithms to automatically create high-quality assembly plans. These assembly plans are then executed in simulation to measure their performance and to visualize their key build characteristics. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach in the LEGO assembly domain. We developed two reference LEGO CAD models that are processed by CompositionalPlanning's algorithmic pipeline. We compare sequential and parallel assembly plans in a Minecraft simulation and show that the time-to-build performance can be optimized by our algorithms.},

Existing efforts in facet modeling are based upon set theory, formal concept analysis, and light-weight ontologies, but in many regards, they are implementations of faceted browsing rather than a specification of the basic, underlying structures and interactions. We will demonstrate that category theory allows us to specify faceted objects and study the relationships and interactions within a faceted browsing system.

abstract = {We present the Semantic Robot Programming (SRP) paradigm as a convergence of robot programming by demonstration and semantic mapping. In SRP, a user can directly program a robot manipulator by demonstrating a snapshot of their intended goal scene in workspace. The robot then parses this goal as a scene graph comprised of object poses and inter-object relations, assuming known object geometries. Task and motion planning is then used to realize the user's goal from an arbitrary initial scene configuration. Even when faced with different initial scene configurations, SRP enables the robot to seamlessly adapt to reach the user's demonstrated goal. For scene perception, we propose the Discriminatively-Informed Generative Estimation of Scenes and Transforms (DIGEST) method to infer the initial and goal states of the world from RGBD images. The efficacy of SRP with DIGEST perception is demonstrated for the task of tray-setting with a Michigan Progress Fetch robot. Scene perception and task execution are evaluated with a public household occlusion dataset and our cluttered scene dataset.},

abstract = {In the semantics of programming, finite data types such as finite lists, have traditionally been modelled by initial algebras. Later final coalgebras were used in order to deal with infinite data types. Coalgebras, which are the dual of algebras, turned out to be suited, moreover, as models for certain types of automata and more generally, for (transition and dynamical) systems. An important property of initial algebras is that they satisfy the familiar principle of induction. Such a principle was missing for coalgebras until the work of Aczel (Non-Well-Founded sets, CSLI Leethre Notes, Vol. 14, center for the study of Languages and information, Stanford, 1988) on a theory of non-wellfounded sets, in which he introduced a proof principle nowadays called coinduction. It was formulated in terms of bisimulation, a notion originally stemming from the world of concurrent programming languages. Using the notion of coalgebra homomorphism, the definition of bisimulation on coalgebras can be shown to be formally dual to that of congruence on algebras. Thus, the three basic notions of universal algebra: algebra, homomorphism of algebras, and congruence, turn out to correspond to coalgebra, homomorphism of coalgebras, and bisimulation, respectively. In this paper, the latter are taken as the basic ingredients of a theory called universal coalgebra. Some standard results from universal algebra are reformulated (using the aforementioned correspondence) and proved for a large class of coalgebras, leading to a series of results on, e.g., the lattices of subcoalgebras and bisimulations, simple coalgebras and coinduction, and a covariety theorem for coalgebras similar to Birkhoff's variety theorem. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The design, simulation and programming of robotics systems is challenging as expertise from multiple domains needs to be integrated conceptually and technically. Domain-specific modeling promises an efficient and flexible concept for developing robotics applications that copes with this challenge. It allows to raise the level of abstraction through the use of specific concepts that are closer to the respective domain concerns and easier to understand and validate. Furthermore, it focuses on increasing the level of automation, e.g. through code generation, to bridge the gap between the modeling and the implementation levels and to improve the efficiency and quality of the software development process. Within this contribution, we survey the literature available on domain-specific (modeling) languages in robotics required to realize a state-of-the-art real-world example from the RoboCup@Work competition. We classify 41 publications in the field as reference for potential DSL users. Furthermore, we analyze these contributions from a DSL-engineering viewpoint and discuss quantitative and qualitative aspects such as the methods and tools used for DSL implementation as well as their documentation status and platform integration. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for discussion in the robotics programming and simulation community based on the insights gained with this survey.},
annote = {DSL for robotics abstract things in order to be closer to the domain of interest. 

Introduced in robotics to separate concerns between functional architecture (behaviors) and software architecture (implementation)

This review paper assess the available and usability of 41 robotic DSLs. 

DSLs are formed by looking at existing code examples and APIs and agreeing upon syntax and semantics from the problem.

DSL approaches considered in survey:
- provide a language definition BNF
- must be text of graphical
- provide an example of concrete syntax
- explanation of mapping to target technology

The example that DSLs will be evaluated against is the PPT (precision place test) which requires a robot grasp an dplace objects in to cavities. Some requirements of the problem include:
- Robot structure (physical representation)
- Coordinate representations and transformations
- Perception
- Reasoning and planning
- Manipulation and grasping
- Coordination
- Motion Control
- Architecture
- Components

This paper provides a list of DSLs and which component of a robot system it contributes to.

It also assesses what is needed for widespread adoption of DSL.

External DSL - defines own syntax and semantics
Internal DSL - embedded within GPL (extend the syntax of host langage with domain specific notation)

Things that affect adoption of DSL:
- Accessibility and documentation
* downloading language, licensing, documentation
* tutorials and examples
- Artifacts and Use-case
* generate executable code
- Evaluation
* Qualitative (conceptual discussion, portability of semantics)
* Quantitative (efficiency, performance + memory, scalability at compile time and system size, productivity of developers of the language, reliability by measuring defects over time)
- Platform
* Range of platform dependency include: (1) proprietary solutions, (2) dependent on software stack or framework (3) transforming DSL code to GPL code
- DSL Development Process
* If the paper describes how they defined the abstractions, it would be helpful},

abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse-definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects-is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms. {\textcopyright} 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Despite recent progress in Reinforcement Learning for robotics applications, many tasks remain prohibitively difficult to solve because of the expensive interaction cost. Transfer learning helps reduce the training time in the target domain by transferring knowledge learned in a source domain. Sim2Real transfer helps transfer knowledge from a simulated robotic domain to a physical target domain. Knowledge transfer reduces the time required to train a task in the physical world, where the cost of interactions is high. However, most existing approaches assume exact correspondence in the task structure and the physical properties of the two domains. This work proposes a framework for Few-Shot Policy Transfer between two domains through Observation Mapping and Behavior Cloning. We use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) along with a cycle-consistency loss to map the observations between the source and target domains and later use this learned mapping to clone the successful source task behavior policy to the target domain. We observe successful behavior policy transfer with limited target task interactions and in cases where the source and target task are semantically dissimilar.},

ReAct! enables students to describe robots' actions and change in dynamic domains without first having to know about the syntactic and semantic details of the underlying formalism, and to solve planning problems using state-of-the-art reasoners without having to know about their input/output language or usage. In particular, ReAct! can be used to represent sophisticated dynamic domains that feature concurrency, indirect effects of actions, and state/transition constraints. ReAct! also allows the embedding of externally defined calculations (e.g., checking for collision-free continuous trajectories) into domain representations of hybrid domains that require a tight integration of (discrete) high-level reasoning with (continuous) geometric reasoning. ReAct! also allows students to solve planning problems that involve complex temporal goals. This broad applicability, and the intelligent interactive user interface, mean that students can work on interesting and challenging domains, ranging from service robotics to cognitive factories, leading to hands-on robotic applications. The efficacy of ReAct! was evaluated from three different points of view: 1) the course outcomes that demonstrate its utility in achieving the learning objectives of a research-oriented cognitive robotics course; 2) the user friendliness and usefulness of ReAct! for students, as evaluated by quantitative student surveys; and 3) instructors' experience of teaching the course either with or without ReAct!.},

abstract = {Robots are increasingly transitioning from specialized, single-task machines to general-purpose systems that operate in diverse and dynamic environments. To address the challenges associated with operation in real-world domains, robots must effectively generalize knowledge, learn, and be transparent in their decision making. This survey examines Semantic Reasoning techniques for robotic systems, which enable robots to encode and use semantic knowledge, including concepts, facts, ideas, and beliefs about the world. Continually perceiving, understanding, and generalizing semantic knowledge allows a robot to identify the meaningful patterns shared between problems and environments, and therefore more effectively perform a wide range of real-world tasks. We identify the three common components that make up a computational Semantic Reasoning Framework: knowledge sources, computational frameworks, and world representations. We analyze the existing implementations and the key characteristics of these components, highlight the many interactions that occur between them, and examine their integration for solving robotic tasks related to five aspects of the world, including objects, spaces, agents, tasks, and actions. By analyzing the computational formulation and underlying mechanisms of existing methods, we provide a unified view of the wide range of semantic reasoning techniques and identify open areas for future research.},

abstract = {Recent trends in planning research have led to empirical comparison becoming commonplace. The field has started to settle into a methodology for such comparisons, which for obvious practical reasons requires running a subset of planners on a subset of problems. In this paper, we characterize the methodology and examine eight implicit assumptions about the problems, planners and metrics used in many of these comparisons. The problem assumptions are: PR1) the performance of a general purpose planner should not be penalized/biased if executed on a sampling of problems and domains, PR2) minor syntactic differences in representation do not affect performance, and PR3) problems should be solvable by STRIPS capable planners unless they require ADL. The planner assumptions are: PL1) the latest version of a planner is the best one to use, PL2) default parameter settings approximate good performance, and PL3) time cut-offs do not unduly bias outcome. The metrics assumptions are: M1) performance degrades similarly for each planner when run on degraded runtime environments (e.g., machine platform) and M2) the number of plan steps distinguishes performance. We find that most of these assumptions are not supported empirically; in particular, that planners are affected differently by these assumptions. We conclude with a call to the community to devote research resources to improving the state of the practice and especially to enhancing the available benchmark problems.},

The scheme has many merits, but sacrifices useful type information in the move to an equational style of reasoning. By contrast, traditional proofs by diagram pasting retain the vital type information, but poorly express the reasoning and development of categorical proofs. In order to combine the strengths of these two perspectives, we propose the use of string diagrams, common folklore in the category theory community, allowing us to retain the type information whilst pursuing a calculational form of proof. These graphical representations provide a topological perspective on categorical proofs, and silently handle functoriality and naturality conditions that require awkward bookkeeping in more traditional notation. Our approach is to proceed primarily by example, systematically applying graphical techniques to many aspects of category theory. We develop string diagrammatic formulations of many common notions, including adjunctions, monads, Kan extensions, limits and colimits. We describe representable functors graphically, and exploit these as a uniform source of graphical calculation rules for many category theoretic concepts. These graphical tools are then used to explicitly prove many standard results in our proposed diagrammatic style.},

The RFD process combines Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to manage system modeling complexity and formal methods to ensure that designs are verifiably correct against their requirements. It consists of a set of levels of abstraction. Each level of abstraction represents a set of requirements and its associated models, simulations, and the relationship between them. Abstraction and refinement functions relate different levels of representation. In this paper, we represent and analyze the RFD process using category theory. Category theory provides us a means (using a collection of objects and arrows) to represent each level of abstractions and communications between them. We represent each level of abstraction using a pullback categorical structure (define the objects and morphisms). The facts and theorems in one level of abstraction will be passed to another via a refinement or an abstraction functor (function). The two functors operate in an inverse (adjoint) relationship. This means refinement traceability is met in the design process fundamentally. Additionally, since adjunction is a weaker relation than any other relations (such as equality, isomorphism, and equivalence) between two categories, it is a relatively better option for relaxing the design space. Finally, we introduce an idea of defining a category of refinements (i.e. a category of functors) and interpreting the universal properties.},

These interventions elicit the structure between the state and action spaces, enabling construction of neural network policies with only relevant states as input. These policies are pretrained using the internal model with domain randomization over the relevant states. The policy network weights are then transferred to the target domain (e.g., the real world) for fine t uning. W e p erform extensive policy transfer experiments in simulation for two representative manipulation tasks: block stacking and crate opening. Our policies are shown to be more robust to domain shifts, more sample efficient t o l earn, a nd s cale t o m ore c omplex settings with larger state spaces. We also show improved zero-shot simto-real transfer of our policies for the block stacking task.},

@article{Adam2017a,
abstract = {—Robotics started employing architecture description languages (ADLs) to model software architectures. While facilitating software engineering, this introduces a gap when reusing solutions encoded in middleware modules. Existing robotics architecture modeling focuses on domain challenges instead of tool modularity. Thus customizing robotics architecture modeling tool to generate solutions conforming to a different middleware is challenging. This could lead to a multitude of incompatible 'vendor-locked' tool modeling chains and hamper reuse in robotics software engineering. We propose a modular architecture modeling method that rests on the separation of model processing, model transformation, and code generation. This facilitates translating architecture models into modules compatible to the middleware of choice. We present this method for the component & connector ADL MontiArcAutomaton, which yields and extensible tool chain to translate software architecture models gradually into middleware modules. Using modular tool chains to support architecture modeling enables reaping the benefits of ADLs while reusing solutions encoded in popular middlewares and, ultimately, facilitates robotics software engineering.},
annote = {This paper presents a modular modeling method for robot architecture that separates model processing, model transformation, and code generation. This allows you to transform from an architecture model to arbitrary target platforms.

Example involves translating from MontiArcAutomaton architecture to ROS.

Architecture to architecture translation

Model driven development (MDD) - lifting to abstract models as the primary development artifact by seeking input from domain experts

M2M (model-to-model)

M2T (model-to-text)

ADL (architecture description language)

Proposed architecture:
Step 1) Generate architecture model in ADL
Step 2) Using M2M transformation, convert architecture model to other architecture model that resembles concepts from target middleware
Step 3) Using M2T transformation, convert target architecture model to code using template engine

[MontiCore]
Includes:
* meta-modeling languge: using EBNF notation which provides context-free grammar (CFG) definitions for concrete and abtract syntax
* compositional model checking framework: validate constraints not expressible in CFG 
compositional context condition framework
* code generation infrastructure: template-based code generation using FreeMarker

Evaluated based on number of templates written when comparing M2T transformation vs. plain transformation

M2M transformation refactors the ADL in MontiCore to match the concepts of an architecture in ROS.

M2T transformation:
The architecture model is parsed into an AST and the AST subtrees are passed to subtemplates appropriately 

Some challenges converting to ROS:
1) translating atomic and composed components into ROS nodes with publishers and subscribers
2) translating connectors to ROS topics
3) translating class diagram data types to ports in rosmsg models
4) creating the configuration file},

When the domain includes many objects, reasoning about the objects and their relationships makes robot planning even more difficult. In this letter, we develop an algorithm called scene analysis for robot planning (SARP) that enables robots to reason with visual contextual information toward achieving long-term goals under uncertainty. SARP constructs scene graphs, a factored representation of objects and their relations, using images captured from different positions, and reasons with them to enable context-aware robot planning under partial observability. Experiments have been conducted using multiple 3D environments in simulation, and a dataset collected by a real robot. In comparison to standard robot planning and scene analysis methods, in a target search domain, SARP improves both efficiency and accuracy in task completion.},

Indeed, we humans are constantly understanding and predicting the actions and goals of others, which allows us to interact in intuitive and safe ways. While action and plan recognition are tasks that humans perform naturally and with little effort, they are still an unresolved problem from the point of view of artificial intelligence. The immense variety of possible actions and plans that may be encountered in an unconstrained environment makes current approaches be far from human-like performance. In addition, while very different types of algorithms have been proposed to tackle the problem of activity, plan, and goal (intention) recognition, these tend to focus in only one part of the problem (e.g., action recognition), and techniques that address the problem as a whole have been not so thoroughly explored. This review is meant to provide a general view of the problem of activity, plan, and goal recognition as a whole. It presents a description of the problem, both from the human perspective and from the computational perspective, and proposes a classification of the main types of approaches that have been proposed to address it (logic-based, classical machine learning, deep learning, and brain-inspired), together with a description and comparison of the classes. This general view of the problem can help on the identification of research gaps, and may also provide inspiration for the development of new approaches that address the problem in a unified way.},

abstract = {A long-standing goal of AI is to enable robots to plan in the face of uncertain and incomplete information, and to handle task failure intelligently. This paper shows how to achieve this. There are two central ideas. The first idea is to organize the robot's knowledge into three layers: instance knowledge at the bottom, commonsense knowledge above that, and diagnostic knowledge on top. Knowledge in a layer above can be used to modify knowledge in the layer(s) below. The second idea is that the robot should represent not just how its actions change the world, but also what it knows or believes. There are two types of knowledge effects the robot's actions can have: epistemic effects (I believe X because I saw it) and assumptions (I'll assume X to be true). By combining the knowledge layers with the models of knowledge effects, we can simultaneously solve several problems in robotics: (i) task planning and execution under uncertainty; (ii) task planning and execution in open worlds; (iii) explaining task failure; (iv) verifying those explanations. The paper describes how the ideas are implemented in a three-layer architecture on a mobile robot platform. The robot implementation was evaluated in five different experiments on object search, mapping, and room categorization.},

Much of the technology that makes robots more human-friendly and adaptable for different applications has emerged from manufacturers of industrial robots. Industrial robots are by far the largest commercial application of robotics technology today. All the important foundations for robot control were initially developed with industrial applications in mind. These applications deserve special attention in order to understand the origin of robotics science and to appreciate many unsolved problems that still prevent the wider use of robots in manufacturing. In this chapter we present a brief history and descriptions of typical industrial robotics applications. We show how robots with different mechanisms fit different applications. Even though robots are well established in large-scale manufacturing, particularly in automobile and related component assembly, there are still many challenging problems to solve. The range of feasible applications could significantly increase if robots were easier to install, to integrate with other manufacturing processes, and to program, particularly with adaptive sensing and automatic error recovery. We outline some of these remaining challenges for researchers.},

Specifically, we leverage the idea of partial amortization for fast adaptation at test time. For this, actions are produced by a policy that is learned over time while the skills it conditions on are chosen using online planning. We demonstrate the benefits of our design decisions across a suite of challenging locomotion tasks and demonstrate improved sample efficiency in single tasks as well as in transfer from one task to another, as compared to competitive baselines.

abstract = {In order to robustly perform tasks based on abstract instructions, robots need sophisticated knowledge processing methods. These methods have to supply the difference between the (often shallow and symbolic) information in the instructions and the (detailed, grounded and often real-valued) information needed for execution. For filling these information gaps, a robot first has to identify them in the instructions, reason about suitable information sources, and combine pieces of information from different sources and of different structure into a coherent knowledge base. To this end we propose the KNOWROB knowledge processing system for robots. In this article, we discuss why the requirements of a robot knowledge processing system differ from what is commonly investigated in AI research, and propose to re-consider a KR system as a semantically annotated view on information and algorithms that are often already available as part of the robot's control system. We then introduce representational structures and a common vocabulary for representing knowledge about robot actions, events, objects, environments, and the robot's hardware as well as inference procedures that operate on this common representation. The KNOWROB system has been released as open-source software and is being used on several robots performing complex object manipulation tasks. We evaluate it through prototypical queries that demonstrate the expressive power and its impact on the robot's performance.},

abstract = {Scene graph is a structured representation of a scene that can clearly express the objects, attributes, and relationships between objects in the scene. As computer vision technology continues to develop, people are no longer satisfied with simply detecting and recognizing objects in images; instead, people look forward to a higher level of understanding and reasoning about visual scenes. For example, given an image, we want to not only detect and recognize objects in the image, but also understand the relationship between objects (visual relationship detection), and generate a text description (image captioning) based on the image content. Alternatively, we might want the machine to tell us what the little girl in the image is doing (Visual Question Answering (VQA)), or even remove the dog from the image and find similar images (image editing and retrieval), etc. These tasks require a higher level of understanding and reasoning for image vision tasks. The scene graph is just such a powerful tool for scene understanding. Therefore, scene graphs have attracted the attention of a large number of researchers, and related research is often cross-modal, complex, and rapidly developing. However, no relatively systematic survey of scene graphs exists at present. To this end, this survey conducts a comprehensive investigation of the current scene graph research. More specifically, we first summarize the general definition of the scene graph, then conducte a comprehensive and systematic discussion on the generation method of the scene graph (SGG) and the SGG with the aid of prior knowledge. We then investigate the main applications of scene graphs and summarize the most commonly used datasets. Finally, we provide some insights into the future development of scene graphs.},

abstract = {One of the most mysterious phenomena in science is the nature of conscious experience. Due to its subjective nature, a reductionist approach is having a hard time in addressing some fundamental questions about consciousness. These questions are squarely and quantitatively tackled by a recently developed theoretical framework, called integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness. In particular, IIT proposes that a maximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS) is identical to conscious experience. However, there has been no principled way to assess the claimed identity. Here, we propose to apply a mathematical formalism, category theory, to assess the proposed identity and suggest that it is important to consider if there exists a proper translation between the domain of conscious experience and that of the MICS. If such translation exists, we postulate that questions in one domain can be answered in the other domain; very difficult questions in the domain of consciousness can be resolved in the domain of mathematics. We claim that it is possible to empirically test if such a functor exists, by using a combination of neuroscientific and computational approaches. Our general, principled and empirical framework allows us to assess the relationship between the domain of consciousness and the domain of mathematical structures, including those suggested by IIT.},

This paper addresses the problem of transferring complex dual-arm sign language motions characterized by the coordination among arms and hands from human to robot, which is seldom considered in previous studies of motion retargeting techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel motion retargeting method that leverages graph optimization and Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) for this problem. We employ DMPs in a leader-follower manner to parameterize the original trajectories while preserving motion rhythm and relative movements between human body parts, and adopt a three-step optimization procedure to find deformed trajectories for robot motion planning while ensuring feasibility for robot execution. Experimental results of several Chinese Sign Language (CSL) motions have been successfully performed on ABB's YuMi dual-arm collaborative robot (14-DOF) with two 6-DOF Inspire-Robotics' multi-fingered hands, a system with 26 DOFs in total.},

abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multi- task learning and sample selection bias, as well as co-variate shift.

abstract = {We study an approach to policy selection for large relational Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We consider a variant of approximate policy iteration (API) that replaces the usual value-function learning step with a learning step in policy space. This is advantageous in domains where good policies are easier to represent and learn than the corresponding value functions, which is often the case for the relational MDPs we are interested in. In order to apply API to such problems, we introduce a relational policy language and corresponding learner. In addition, we introduce a new bootstrapping routine for goal-based planning domains, based on random walks. Such bootstrapping is necessary for many large relational MDPs, where reward is extremely sparse, as API is ineffective in such domains when initialized with an uninformed policy. Our experiments show that the resulting system is able to find good policies for a number of classical planning domains and their stochastic variants by solving them as extremely large relational MDPs. The experiments also point to some limitations of our approach, suggesting future work. {\textcopyright} 2006 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Task-priority inverse kinematics is a popular motion control algorithm which efficiently handles redundancy in robot manipulators. It has been recently extended in order to handle also set-based control objectives or inequality constraints. As any local motion planner it is prone to the occurrence of local minima. This work further extends set-based inverse kinematics by adding a motion planner in order to avoid such occurrence. Motion planners are usually computationally heavy especially in their eventual implementation with a task-priority architecture. To reduce this issue, the planner is implemented as a sampling-based algorithm which works in the reduced-dimensionality of the robot workspace applying Cartesian constraints only. The output trajectory is then checked against the inverse kinematics algorithm exploiting the redundancy and verifying the fulfillment of the joint-based task constraints. During the motion, inverse kinematics is then used also in real-Time to ensure a reactive behavior to address, e.g., mismatch between the a-priori information and real-Time perception acquisition. Also, the motion planner runs in background to adapt to changes in the environment or to accommodate incremental mapping. Comparison with alternative approaches are investigated and discussed. The most promising method is validated first in hundreds of numerical simulations to provide a solid statistical analysis and then experimentally with a Kinova Jaco2 7 DOFs manipulator equipped with an RGB-D sensor. Note to Practitioners-In this work we propose a motion planning algorithm that allows to effectively deploy robot manipulators in partially unstructured environments. It is structured in two layers: A Cartesian space global planner guarantees the feasibility of the trajectory with respect to potential obstacles in the environment, while a reactive local planner checks the feasibility at joint level. This architecture allows to define all the safety constraints both at Cartesian and joint space needed to operate in unstructured environments, while keeping the computation time lower with respect to standard approaches that define all the constraints in an offline global planner. The reduced computation time allows to effectively perform real-Time replanning operations when needed, making the robotic system capable of adapting to a dynamic environment and suitable for sharing its workspace with human operators.},

abstract = {Frederick A. Leve—Program Officer—Dynamics and Control (Abstract may be publicly released) The new world of interconnected-everything brings new challenges to those who wish to understand it and keep society safe from unintended and unimagined consequences. With constant communication and feedback loops being the norm, the space of behaviors is too large to analyze by simulation alone. Today's nearly unlimited computational power must be used more wisely, so that our knowledge of a system can evolve along with the system itself. New mathematical techniques are needed to provide the algebraic formulas for combining our insights, just as we combine components, allowing us to anticipate the behavior of an assembled system. Category theory is the mathematics of combination and compositionality, so it is well-suited as a foundation for such work. We propose to investigate compositional techniques for analyzing systems of all sorts. At the mathematical center of many disciplines, one needs to solve a system of simultaneous equations. As mundane, abstract, and worked-over as this may seem, a new elementary technique was recently discovered with the potential to change how we approach such problems. This technique is highly compositional—the solutions to subsystems can be combined to form a solution of the whole—and it emerged out of a similarly compositional approach to understanding the behavior of networked machines. Just as circuits can be combined to form computers, machines of all scales can be interconnected to form more complex machines. The common theme is compositionality: whether combining the constraints and requirements necessary to design a robot, or combining the equations that describe its function, our goal is to find analyses that are scalable and reusable, so that the knowledge we gain today is efficiently utilized in the networks of tomorrow.},

We identify several challenges towards this goal and propose a transferring approach with a parameter-compositional formulation. We investigate ways to improve the training of multi-task reinforcement learning which serves as the foundation for transferring. Then we conduct a number of transferring experiments on various manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can have improved performance in the multi-task training stage, and further show effective transferring in terms of both sample efficiency and performance.},

Robot skills learning approaches to develop humanoid robotic systems would have greater impact if the models of the skill can be operated upon to generate new behaviours of increasing levels of complexity. A framework that allows the adaptation of a robot previously learned motion skills to new unseen contexts is necessary. In this work we present different modalities for the adaptation and generation of new skill models based on the already learned models of skills.

This article mainly centers on the human-robot transmission of the mobile medical robot for narrow space autonomous motion. In order to enable mobile medical robots to autonomously and smoothly transport hospital casualties through narrow aisles, in this paper, we present a robot skill transfer technology, namely a human-robot skill transfer framework of mobile medical robots for autonomous motion with teaching by demonstration, which is that a smooth optimal path is planned through the human motion, and then the Kinect sensor is used to detect human bone movement to learn its motion trajectory so as to achieve trajectory tracking control. Meanwhile, using the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) constraint to minimize the error between the actual trajectory of the medical robot and the tracking reference path to control the motion trajectory accurately, human-computer interactive mobile medical robots can smoothly pass through narrow channels. Through research and analysis, it is demonstrated that the mobile medical robot proposed in this paper has great feasibility, which is of great reference value in the field of medical rescue.},

  abstract      = {Imitation learning is an effective approach for autonomous systems to acquire control policies when an explicit reward function is unavailable, using supervision provided as demonstrations from an expert, typically a human operator. However, standard imitation learning methods assume that the agent receives examples of observation-action tuples that could be provided, for instance, to a supervised learning algorithm. This stands in contrast to how humans and animals imitate: we observe another person performing some behavior and then figure out which actions will realize that behavior, compensating for changes in viewpoint, surroundings, object positions and types, and other factors. We term this kind of imitation learning 'imitation-from-observation,' and propose an imitation learning method based on video prediction with context translation and deep reinforcement learning. This lifts the assumption in imitation learning that the demonstration should consist of observations in the same environment configuration, and enables a variety of interesting applications, including learning robotic skills that involve tool use simply by observing videos of human tool use. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach in learning a wide range of real-world robotic tasks modeled after common household chores from videos of a human demonstrator, including sweeping, ladling almonds, pushing objects as well as a number of tasks in simulation.},

  abstract      = {Despite recent progress in Reinforcement Learning for robotics applications, many tasks remain prohibitively difficult to solve because of the expensive interaction cost. Transfer learning helps reduce the training time in the target domain by transferring knowledge learned in a source domain. Sim2Real transfer helps transfer knowledge from a simulated robotic domain to a physical target domain. Knowledge transfer reduces the time required to train a task in the physical world, where the cost of interactions is high. However, most existing approaches assume exact correspondence in the task structure and the physical properties of the two domains. This work proposes a framework for Few-Shot Policy Transfer between two domains through Observation Mapping and Behavior Cloning. We use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) along with a cycle-consistency loss to map the observations between the source and target domains and later use this learned mapping to clone the successful source task behavior policy to the target domain. We observe successful behavior policy transfer with limited target task interactions and in cases where the source and target task are semantically dissimilar.},

  abstract  = {This letter presents our solution for the Real Robot Challenge III1, aiming to address dexterous robotic manipulation tasks through learning from offline data. In this competition, participants were given two types of datasets for each task: expert and mixed. Each expert dataset is collected by a high-skill policy, whereas the mixed dataset is collected using both expert and non-expert policies. We found that the vanilla behavioural cloning (BC) can learn a very proficient policy with minimal human intervention when trained on expert datasets. Notably, BC outperformed even the most advanced offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, when applied to mixed datasets, the performance of BC deteriorates; similarly, the performance of offline RL algorithms is also less than satisfactory. Upon examining the provided datasets, it was apparent that each mixed dataset contained a significant proportion of expert data, which should enable the training of a proficient BC agent. However, the expert data is not labelled in the datasets. As a result, we propose a classifier to identify the pattern of the expert behaviour within a mixed dataset and then utilize it to isolate the expert data. To further boost the BC performance, we take advantage of the geometric symmetry of the arena to augment the training dataset through mathematical transformations. Ultimately, our submission outperformed that of all other participants.},

We pose this class of problem under a worst-case model within the framework of procrustean graphs, formulating the disclosure policy as a particular type of map on edge labels. We devise algorithms that, given a planning problem supplemented with an information stipulation, can find a plan, associated disclosure policy, or both jointly, if and only if some exists. The pair together, comprising the plan and associated disclosure policy, may depend subtly on additional information available to the observer, such as whether the observer knows the robot's plan (e.g., leaked via a side-channel). Our implementation finds a plan and a suitable disclosure policy, jointly, when any such pair exists, albeit for small problem instances.},

However, traditional centralized communication links cannot traverse the further victims with information-sharing requirements. And the even communication link distribution leads to a load burden on the crowded victim area. Thus, we propose a three-layer architecture consisting of the emergency communication vehicle, backbone links, and branch links to rapidly recover communication via mobile robots. Then, considering victims' distribution, an improved MaxMin distance algorithm is presented as the basis of robot dispatch. The relay probability of the link is also estimated with closed formulae. Finally, simulation results verify that our proposed algorithm can recover communication with lower delay and higher packet delivery ratio.},

abstract = {Aggregating data in a database could also be called "integrating along fibers": given functions $\pi\colon E\to D$ and $s\colon E\to R$, where $(R,\circledast)$ is a commutative monoid, we want a new function $(\circledast s)_\pi$ that sends each $d\in D$ to the "sum" of all $s(e)$ for which $\pi(e)=d$. The operation lives alongside querying -- or more generally data migration -- in typical database usage: one wants to know how much Canadians spent on cell phones in 2021, for example, and such requests typically require both aggregation and querying. But whereas querying has an elegant category-theoretic treatment in terms of parametric right adjoints between copresheaf categories, a categorical formulation of aggregation -- especially one that lives alongside that for querying -- appears to be completely absent from the literature. In this paper we show how both querying and aggregation fit into the "polynomial ecosystem". Starting with the category $\mathbf{Poly}$ of polynomial functors in one variable, we review the relatively recent results of Ahman-Uustalu and Garner, which showed that the framed bicategory $\mathbb{C}\mathbf{at}^\sharp$ of comonads in $\mathbf{Poly}$ is precisely the right setting for data migration: its objects are categories and its bicomodules are parametric right adjoints between their copresheaf categories. We then develop a great deal of theory, compressed for space reasons, including local monoidal closed structures, a coclosure to bicomodule composition, and an understanding of adjoints in $\mathbb{C}\mathbf{at}^\sharp$. Doing so allows us to derive interesting mathematical results, e.g.\ that the ordinary operation of transposing a span can be decomposed into the composite of two more primitive operations, and then finally to explain how aggregation arises, alongside querying, in $\mathbb{C}\mathbf{at}^\sharp$.},

They have played a fundamental role in the development of many areas of modern mathematics, yet the broad conceptual power of sheaf theory and its wide applicability to areas beyond pure math have only recently begun to be appreciated. Taking an applied category theory perspective, Sheaf Theory through Examples provides an approachable introduction to elementary sheaf theory and examines applications including n-colorings of graphs, satellite data, chess problems, Bayesian networks, self-similar groups, musical performance, complexes, and much more.With an emphasis on developing the theory via a wealth of well-motivated and vividly illustrated examples, Sheaf Theory through Examples supplements the formal development of concepts with philosophical reflections on topology, category theory, and sheaf theory, alongside a selection of advanced topics and examples that illustrate ideas like cellular sheaf cohomology, toposes, and geometric morphisms.Sheaf Theory through Examples seeks to bridge the powerful results of sheaf theory as used by mathematicians and real-world applications, while also supplementing the technical matters with a unique philosophical perspective attuned to the broader development of ideas.The open access edition of this book was made possible by generous funding from Arcadia – a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.}",

	abstract = {We demonstrate how category theory provides specifications that can efficiently be implemented via imperative algorithms and apply this to the field of graph transformation. By examples, we show how this paradigm of software development makes it easy to quickly write correct and performant code. We provide a modern implementation of graph rewriting techniques at the level of abstraction of finitely-presented C-sets and clarify the connections between C-sets and the typed graphs supported in existing rewriting software. We emphasize that our open-source library is extensible: by taking new categorical constructions (such as slice categories, structured cospans, and distributed graphs) and relating their limits and colimits to those of their underlying categories, users inherit efficient algorithms for pushout complements and (final) pullback complements. This allows one to perform double-, single-, and sesqui-pushout rewriting over a broad class of data structures. Graph transformation researchers, scientists, and engineers can then use this library to computationally manipulate rewriting systems and apply them to their domains of interest.},

  abstract        = {Classical planning representation languages based on first-order logic have been extensively used to model and solve planning problems, but they struggle to capture implicit preconditions and effects that arise in complex planning scenarios. To address this problem, we propose an alternative approach to representing and transforming world states during planning. Based on the category-theoretic concepts of $\mathsf{C}$-sets and double-pushout rewriting (DPO), our proposed representation can effectively handle structured knowledge about world states that support domain abstractions at all levels. It formalizes the semantics of predicates according to a user-provided ontology and preserves the semantics when transitioning between world states. This method provides a formal semantics for using knowledge graphs and relational databases to model world states and updates in planning. In this paper, we compare our category-theoretic representation with the classical planning representation. We show that our proposed representation has advantages over the classical representation in terms of handling implicit preconditions and effects, and provides a more structured framework in which to model and solve planning problems.},

  abstract        = {Task planning is the problem of finding a discrete sequence of actions to achieve a goal. Unfortunately, task planning in robotic domains is computationally challenging. To address this, in our prior work, we explained how knowledge from a successful task solution can be cached for later use, as an “abstract skill.” Such a skill is represented as a trace of states (“road map”) in an abstract space and can be matched with new tasks on-demand. This paper explains how one can use a library of abstract skills, derived from past planning experience, to reduce the computational cost of solving new task planning problems. As we explain, matching a skill to a task allows us to decompose it into independent sub-tasks, which can be quickly solved in parallel. This can be done automatically and dynamically during planning. We begin by formulating this problem of “planning with skills” as a constraint satisfaction problem. We then provide a hierarchical solution algorithm, which integrates with any standard task planner. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the computational benefits of the approach for reach-avoid tasks.},

  abstract        = {Solving realistic robotic task planning problems is computationally demanding. To better exploit the planning effort and reduce the future planning cost, it is important to increase the reusability of successful plans. To this end, we suggest a systematic and automatable approach for plan transfer, by rethinking the plan caching procedure. Specifically, instead of caching successful plans in their original domain, we suggest transferring them upon discovery to a dynamically-defined abstract domain and cache them as “abstract skills” there. This technique allows us to maintain a unified, standardized, and compact skill database, to avoid skill redundancy, and to support lifelong operation. Cached skills can later be reconstructed into new domains on demand, and be applied to new tasks, with no human intervention. This is made possible thanks to the novel concept of “abstraction keys.” An abstraction key, when coupled with a skill, provides all the necessary information to cache it, reconstruct it, and transfer it across all domains in which it is applicable—even domains we have yet to encounter. We practically demonstrate the approach by providing two examples of such keys and explain how they can be used in a manipulation planning domain.},

The core concept — reusing prior knowledge to learn in and from novel situations — is successfully leveraged by humans to handle novel situations. In recent years, transfer learning has received renewed interest from the community from different perspectives, including imitation learning, domain adaptation, and transfer of experience from simulation to the real world, among others. In this paper, we unify the concept of transfer learning in robotics and provide the first taxonomy of its kind considering the key concepts of robot, task, and environment. Through a review of the promises and challenges in the field, we identify the need of transferring at different abstraction levels, the need of quantifying the transfer gap and the quality of transfer, as well as the dangers of negative transfer. Via this position paper, we hope to channel the effort of the community towards the most significant roadblocks to realize the full potential of transfer learning in robotics.},

@article{Ju2022,
  abstract        = {Deep reinforcement learning has achieved great success in many fields and has shown promise in learning robust skills for robot control in recent years. However, sampling efficiency and safety problems still limit its application to robot control in the real world. One common solution is to train the robot control policy in a simulation environment and transfer it to the real world. However, policies trained in simulations usually have unsatisfactory performance in the real world because simulators inevitably model reality imperfectly. Inspired by biological transfer learning processes in the brains of humans and other animals, sim-to-real transfer reinforcement learning has been proposed and has become a focus of researchers applying reinforcement learning to robotics. Here, we describe state-of-the-art sim-to-real transfer reinforcement learning methods, which are inspired by insights into transfer learning in nature, such as extracting features in common between tasks, enriching training experience, multitask learning, continual learning and fast learning. Our objective is to present a comprehensive survey of the most recent advances in sim-to-real transfer reinforcement learning. We hope it can facilitate the application of deep reinforcement learning to solve complex robot control problems in the real world.},

Here we describe an application of category theory to describe structural and resulting functional properties of biological protein materials by developing so-called ologs. An olog is like a “concept web” or “semantic network” except that it follows a rigorous mathematical formulation based on category theory. This key difference ensures that an olog is unambiguous, highly adaptable to evolution and change, and suitable for sharing concepts with other olog. We consider simple cases of beta-helical and amyloid-like protein filaments subjected to axial extension and develop an olog representation of their structural and resulting mechanical properties. We also construct a representation of a social network in which people send text-messages to their nearest neighbors and act as a team to perform a task. We show that the olog for the protein and the olog for the social network feature identical category-theoretic representations, and we proceed to precisely explicate the analogy or isomorphism between them. The examples presented here demonstrate that the intrinsic nature of a complex system, which in particular includes a precise relationship between structure and function at different hierarchical levels, can be effectively represented by an olog. This, in turn, allows for comparative studies between disparate materials or fields of application, and results in novel approaches to derive functionality in the design of de novo hierarchical systems. We discuss opportunities and challenges associated with the description of complex biological materials by using ologs as a powerful tool for analysis and design in the context of materiomics, and we present the potential impact of this approach for engineering, life sciences, and medicine.},

In this demo, we focus on the three main pillars of planning.domains: (1) api.planning.domains – a programmatic interface to all existing planning problems; (2) solver.planning.domains – an open (and extendable) interface to planning-in-the-cloud; and (3) editor.planning.domains - a fully featured editor for planning domains.}

abstract = {Executing temporal plans in the real and open world requires adapting to uncertainty both in the environment and in the plan actions. A plan executor must therefore be flexible to dispatch actions based on the actual execution conditions. In general, this involves considering both event and time-based constraints between the actions in the plan. A simple temporal network (STN) is a convenient framework for specifying the constraints between actions in the plan. Likewise, a behavior tree (BT) is a convenient framework for controlling the execution flow of the actions in the plan. The principle contributions of this paper are i) an algorithm for transforming a plan into an STN, and ii) an algorithm for transforming an STN into a BT. When combined, these algorithms define a systematic approach for executing total-order (time-triggered) plans in robots operating in the real world. Our approach is based on creating a graph describing a deordered (state-triggered) plan and then creating a BT representing a partial-order (determined at runtime) plan. This approach ensures the correct execution of plans, including those with required concurrency. We demonstrate the validity of our approach within the PlanSys2 framework on real robots.},

  abstract = {Planning is the model-based approach to autonomous behavior where the agent behavior is derived automatically from a model of the actions, sensors, and goals. The main challenges in planning are computational as all models, whether featuring uncertainty and feedback or not, are intractable in the worst case when represented in compact form. In this book, we look at a variety of models used in AI planning, and at the methods that have been developed for solving them. The goal is to provide a modern and coherent view of planning that is precise, concise, and mostly self-contained, without being shallow. For this, we make no attempt at covering the whole variety of planning approaches, ideas, and applications, and focus on the essentials. The target audience of the book are students and researchers interested in autonomous behavior and planning from an AI, engineering, or cognitive science perspective.

abstract = {A theory of analogy must describe how the meaning of an analogy is derived from the meanings of its parts. In the structure-mapping theory, the interpretation rules ar echaracterized as implicit rules for mapping knowledge about a base domain into a target domain. Two important features of the theory are (a) the rules depend only on syntactic properties of the knowledge representation, and not on the specific content of the domains; and (b) the theoretical framework allows analogies to be distinguished cleanly from literal similarity statements, applications of abstractions, and other kinds of comparisons. Two mapping principles are described: (a) Relations between objects, rather than attributes of objects, are mapped from base to target; and (b) The particular relations mapped are determined by systematicity, as defined by the existence of higher-order relations},

@article{Kolodner1983,
abstract = {This study presents a process model of very long-term episodic memory. The process presented is a reconstructive process. The process involves application of three kinds of reconstructive strategies-component-to-context instantiation strategies, component-instantiation strategies, and context-to-context instantiation strategies. The first is used to direct search to appropriate conceptual categories in memory. The other two are used to direct search within the chosen conceptual category. A fourth type of strategy, called executive search strategies, guide search for concepts related to the one targeted for retrieval. A conceptual memory organization implied by human reconstructive memory is presented along with examples which motivate it. A basic retrieval algorithm is presented for traversing that stucture. Retrieval strategies arise from failures in that algorithm. The memory organization and retrieval processes are implemented in a computer program called CYRUS which stores events in the lives of former Secretaries of State Cyrus Vance and Edmund Muskie and answers questions posed in English concerning that information. Examples which motivate the process model are drawn from protocols of human memory search. Examples of CYRUS'S behavior demonstrate the implemented process model. Conclusions are drawn concerning retrieval failures and the relationship of episodic and semantic memory. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {The amount of research papers published nowadays related to ontology matching is remarkable and we believe that reflects the growing interest of the research community. However, for new practitioners that approach the field, this amount of information might seem overwhelming. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to help in guiding new practitioners get a general idea on the state of the field and to determine possible research lines. To do so, we first perform a literature review of the field in the last decade by means of an online search. The articles retrieved are sorted using a classification framework that we propose, and the different categories are revised and analyzed. The information in this review is extended and supported by the results obtained by a survey that we have designed and conducted among the practitioners.},

abstract = {The effort described in this paper attempts to integrate agility aspects in the “Agility Performance of Robotic Systems” (APRS) project, developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The new technical idea for the APRS project is to develop the measurement science in the form of an integrated agility framework enabling manufacturers to assess and assure the agility performance of their robot systems. This framework includes robot agility performance metrics, information models, test methods, and protocols. This paper presents models for the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), used within the APRS project. PDDL is an attempt to standardize Artificial Intelligence planning languages. The described models have been fully defined in the XML Schema Definition Language (XSDL) and in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) for kit building applications. Kit building or kitting is a process that brings parts that will be used in assembly operations together in a kit and then moves the kit to the area where the parts are used in the final assembly. Furthermore, the paper discusses a tool that is capable of automatically and dynamically generating PDDL files from the models in order to generate a plan or to replan from scratch. Finally, the ability of the tool to update a PDDL problem file from a relational database for replanning to recover from failures is presented.}

ABSTRACT={Programing sophisticated robots, such as service robots or humanoids, are still a complex endeavor. Although programming robotic applications requires specialist knowledge, a robot software environment should support convenient development, while maintaining full flexibility needed when realizing challenging robotics tasks. In addition, several desirable properties should be fulfilled, such as robustness, reusability of existing programs, and skill transfer between robots. In this work, we introduce the ArmarX statechart concept, which is used for describing control and data flow of robot programs. This event-driven statechart approach of ArmarX helps realizing important features, such as increased robustness through distributed program execution, convenient programming through graphical user interfaces, and versatility by interweaving dynamic statechart structure with custom user code. We show that using hierarchical and distributed statecharts increases reusability, allows skill transfer between robots, and hides complexity in robot programming by splitting robot behavior into control flow and functionality.}
