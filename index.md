I am a Computer Science PhD Student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am interested generally in the synchronization of model viewpoints of an engineered system. My current research is focused on formal traceability, change propagation, and synthesis within autonomous systems using category theory.

I am also a software engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory where I have designed and implemented prototype software platforms that support [image analysis for humanitarian and disaster relief](https://www.jhuapl.edu/PressRelease/190926), [test and evaluation of metagenomic classifiers](https://github.com/JHUAPL/meta-system), and data integration and analysis of social media and other publicly available information.

My topic areas of interest include category theory, robotics, software engineering design, computer vision, and geospatial information systems. My hobbies include film-making, video editing, and going on scenic walks.
